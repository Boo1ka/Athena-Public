# Protocol 046: The Kelly Mandate

> **Core Axiom**: "To win in the long run, you must first survive the short run."
> **Corollary**: "Optimization without Survival is Suicide."

## 1. The Paradox (Arithmetic vs Geometric)

Humans intuitively solve for **Arithmetic Mean** (Ensemble Average).
Reality rewards **Geometric Mean** (Time Average).

* **Arithmetic (The Trap)**: Bet 100% on a 60/40 coin flip.
  * *Result*: In 1,000 parallel universes, the average wealth is infinite. In YOUR universe, you are broke by Round 5.
  * *Name*: **Ergodicity Breaking**.

## 2. The Golden Algorithm

To become "The House," you must satisfy all three variables:

1. **Selection (+EV)**: Play games where you have a proven edge. ($EV > 0$)
2. **Sizing (Fractional Kelly)**: Bet small enough to render Ruin impossible. ($RoR \approx 0$)
3. **Volume (N -> ∞)**: Play enough hands to realize the edge.

> **Failure Modes**:
>
> * Skip #1: You lose slowly (Casino Player).
> * Skip #2: You bust quickly (Degenerate Gambler).
> * Skip #3: You rely on luck (Amateur).

## 3. The Volatility Tax (Simulation Data)

Simulation of 10,000 runs (100 rounds, 60/40 edge, $10k start).

| Strategy | Logic | Median Wealth | Max Drawdown | Ruin Risk (>90%) | Probability of Profit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Full Kelly (20%)** | "Math Optimal" | $74,898 | **77%** | **16.8%** | 82.3% |
| **Half Kelly (10%)** | "Pro Standard" | $45,005 | 49% | **0.1%** | 94.0% |
| **Quarter Kelly (5%)** | "Safe / Nit" | $24,005 | **28%** | **0.0%** | **95.9%** |

* **The Lesson**: We pay a **Volatility Tax** (accepting lower theoretical median) to buy **Ruin Insurance** (0% risk of death).
* **The Mandate**: Never exceed Half-Kelly (10% Equivalent) in high-variance domains.

## 4. Asymmetry of Loss

A loss hurts geometrically more than a gain helps.

* Loss of 50% $\to$ Requires +100% to break even.
* Loss of 90% $\to$ Requires +900% to break even.

**Full Kelly** bets typically dig holes so deep that the "winning streak" required to equality is statistically impossible within a human lifetime.

## 5. Application

* **Poker**: 100-200 Buy-ins (0.5% - 1% Risk).
* **Trading**: 1-2% Risk per Trade.
* **Life**: Never bet the "core" (reputation, freedom, health) on a single decision, regardless of EV.
