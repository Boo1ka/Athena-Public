# Protocol 96: The Income Hierarchy

> **Source**: Session 49 crystallization (Dec 2025)  
> **Trigger**: When evaluating career moves, business ideas, or "self-employment" viability  
> **Purpose**: Classify income sources to avoid the "hand stop, mouth stop" trap

## 1. The Four Levels

| Level | Name | Definition | Leverage | Example |
|:-----:|:-----|:-----------|:---------|:--------|
| **0** | Employee | Work for one boss | None | Salaried job |
| **1** | Freelancer | Work for many bosses (clients) | Time diversification only | Grab driver, tutor |
| **2** | Service Biz | Others work for you | Margin on labor | Agency, F&B with staff |
| **3** | Asset Owner | The asset works for you | Compounding | SaaS, content, equity |

---

## 2. The Critical Distinction

> **The Trap**: Most "self-employed" in SG are Level 1-2. They escaped the job but not the time-money ceiling.

| Metric | Level 0-2 | Level 3 |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Income ceiling** | Hours × Rate | ∞ (Compounding) |
| **Vacation test** | Income stops | Income continues |
| **Exit value** | ~0 | Sellable asset |
| **Scaling** | Hire more people | Build more leverage |

**The "Hand Stop, Mouth Stop" Test:**
> If you stop working for 6 months, does income continue?  
>
> - **No** → Level 0-2 (Linear)  
> - **Yes** → Level 3 (Exponential)

## 3. Level Transitions

### 0 → 1 (Employee → Freelancer)

- **Action**: Get clients instead of one employer
- **Trap**: Same work, more admin, less security
- **Reality Check**: Often a downgrade disguised as freedom

### 1 → 2 (Freelancer → Service Biz)

- **Action**: Hire people, take margin
- **Trap**: You become a manager, not free. Staff problems replace client problems.
- **Reality Check**: Still linear unless you have 10+ employees with strong processes

### 2 → 3 (Service Biz → Asset Owner)

- **Action**: Productize service, build recurring revenue, or exit
- **The Real Leap**: From selling time (yours or others') to owning something that appreciates
- **Examples**: Agency → SaaS, Restaurant → Franchise, Consulting → Course

## 4. Application Protocol

When evaluating any income opportunity:

1. **Classify**: "What level is this?"
2. **Trajectory**: "Does this move me UP or SIDEWAYS?"
3. **Asset Test**: "After 5 years, what do I own that I can sell?"
4. **Time Test**: "If I stop, does money stop?"

### Red Flags (Disguised Level 1)

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| "Be your own boss" | Be your own employee |
| "Unlimited earning potential" | Unlimited working hours |
| "Passive income" (MLM) | Active recruiting income |
| "Self-employed" hawker | Self-employed chef |

## 5. The Strategic Path

```text
[L0] Employee
  ↓ (Don't just quit)
[L1] Freelancer ← SKIP IF POSSIBLE
  ↓ (Or go direct)
[L2] Service Biz ← Build processes, not just revenue
  ↓ (The hard leap)
[L3] Asset Owner ← The only destination that matters
```

**Key Insight**: The goal is not to climb every level. The goal is to reach Level 3 as efficiently as possible, skipping levels if you can.

## 6. Integration with Other Protocols

- **Protocol 91 (Pearson Synthesis)**: Stair-stepping model for Level transitions
- **Strategic Analysis Framework (Business Frameworks)**: Four Fits analysis for viability
- **Protocol 92 (De Facto Rules)**: Political capital needed at each level
