# Protocol 230: Unit Economics Physics

> **"Profit is the Efficiency Shield that protects the organism from expiring."**

## 1. The Core Definition

**Unit Economics** answers one question: *"Does the existence of ONE unit of this product create cash or burn cash?"*

It is the atomic physics of business. If the atom is unstable (negative unit economics), the universe (the business) will collapse when scaled.

### Two Dialects

| Context | Definition | Formula |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Physical (Atoms)** | Contribution Margin | `Price - Variable Cost (COGS)` |
| **Digital (Bits)** | LTV / CAC | `Lifetime Value / Acquisition Cost` |

## 2. The "Chicken Rice" Model (Physical World)

Use this mental model for any business selling atoms (F&B, E-commerce, Hardware).

**Scenario**: Selling Chicken Rice at $3.50.

### The Unit Math

* **Price**: $3.50
* **COGS (Variable)**: $1.20 (Rice, Chicken, Gas) involves *only* costs that occur *because* that specific plate exists.
* **Contribution Margin (CM)**: **$2.30**

> **Insight**: You do not "make" $3.50. You "make" $2.30. The first $1.20 vanishes instantly to the supplier.

### The Survival Math (Breakeven)

Fixed Costs ("Existence Tax") must be paid by the CM.

* **Fixed Costs (OpEx)**: $3,000/month (Rent, Manpower).
* **Calculation**: `$3,000 / $2.30 (CM)` = **1,305 plates**.

| Zone | Volume | Result |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Death Zone** | < 49 plates/day | Slowly bleeding to death. |
| **Zombie Zone** | 50 plates/day | Working for free ("Volunteer"). |
| **Life Zone** | > 51 plates/day | First dollar of actual profit. |

## 3. The "Efficiency Shield" Concept

**Profit is not greed.**

* **Scenario**: You lower price to $3.00 to be "nice".
* **New CM**: $1.80 ($3.00 - $1.20).
* **New Breakeven**: `$3,000 / $1.80` = **1,666 plates** (64/day).

**The Cost of "Nice"**:

* New require volume: +28%.
* Did your energy increase by 28%? No.
* You are now working harder to stay in the same place.

**Profit** acts as a buffer against variance (bad days, price hikes). Without it, a single perturbation sends the system into irreversible ruin (Law #1).

## 4. Scalability Trap (Digital World)

In startups, founders often confuse **Cash Flow** with **Unit Profit**.

* Selling $1.00 for $0.90 is fine if you sell 1.
* It is fatal if you sell 1,000,000.
* **Trap**: "We'll fix the unit economics at scale."
* **Reality**: You usually cannot fix physics *after* building the building.

## 5. Summary Checks

Before launching *anything*:

1. **Define the Unit**: What is "one" item?
2. **Calculate CM**: `Price - Direct Costs`. Is it positive?
3. **Calculate Survival Volume**: `Fixed Costs / CM`. Is this number physically possible?
