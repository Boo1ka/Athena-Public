# Protocol 106: Distribution Physics

> **Purpose**: Heuristics for traffic generation, market entry, and layered growth.
> **Source**: Extracted from Samuel Rondot Case Study (CS037) & Taylor Pearson's "Distribution > Product" thesis.

## 1. The Core Law

> **"First Time Founders obsess over Product. Second Time Founders obsess over Distribution."**

**The Physics:**

- **Product** = Potential Energy (Static)
- **Distribution** = Kinetic Energy (Dynamic)
- **Revenue** = Product × Distribution

**Implication**: A mediocre product with great distribution wins. A great product with zero distribution dies.

## 2. The Validated Cloning Playbook (Samuel Rondot)

**Core Principle**: "Never build something that doesn't already exist and isn't already successful."

### The 4-Layer Distribution Stack

| Layer | Type | Mechanism | Speed | Risk |
|-------|------|-----------|-------|------|
| **1. Paid Ads** | Validator | Buy traffic immediately to test offer/LP. | ⚡ Instant | 💰 High Cost |
| **2. SEO** | Moat | Capture intent traffic. Compounds over time. | 🐢 Slow | ⏳ High Effort |
| **3. UGC** | Viral | Faceless videos on TikTok/Shorts/Reels. | 📈 Exponential | 🎲 Variance |
| **4. Affiliates** | Leverage | Other people's audience. Fixed CAC. | 🤝 Network | 📉 Low Risk |

**Execution Order**:

1. **Validate with Ads**: If you can't sell it with ads, you can't sell it with SEO.
2. **Compound with SEO**: Once validated, lower CAC by building organic traffic.
3. **Scale with UGC/Affiliates**: Expand reach once core economics work.

## 3. Traffic Source Forensics

**Method**: Use tools (Ahrefs/SimilarWeb) to reverse-engineer competitor growth.

- **Observed Pattern**: 90% Direct Traffic? -> Branding/Word of Mouth (Hard to copy).
- **Observed Pattern**: 80% Paid Search? -> Arbitrage Play (Easy to copy, check margins).
- **Observed Pattern**: 70% Social? -> Viral/Content Play (Hard to copy active effort).
- **Observed Pattern**: 60% Organic Search? -> SEO Play (Copyable with better content/backlinks).

## 4. The "1% Better" Heuristic

Don't reinvent the wheel. Just grease the axle.

**Valid Improvements**:

- **Design/UX**: Make it look 2025 (Premium), not 2015.
- **Speed**: Make it load in 0.5s instead of 3s.
- **Positioning**: Niche down (e.g., "CRM for Plumbers" vs "CRM").
- **Business Model**: One-time payment vs Subscription (or vice versa).
