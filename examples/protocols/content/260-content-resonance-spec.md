# Protocol 260: The Resonance Spec

> **Purpose**: Standardize the "Spec Sheet" for content creation to ensure client resonance.

## 1. The Core Metric: "That's Me" (Λ > 0)

Content is not measured by "views" or "likes." It is measured by **Resonance Events**.
A Resonance Event occurs when the user involuntarily says: **"That's me."**

### The Litmus Test

Before publishing, apply this binary filter:

* ❌ **Fail**: Describes the solution. ("We do branding.")
* ✅ **Pass**: Describes the *symptom* so precisely they assume you have the cure. ("It's 11 PM and you hate your logo.")

## 2. The Spec Sheet (Implementation)

Every piece of content must satisfy the following 4 fields:

| Field | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. The Stick Scenario** | Specific time/place of pain. | "11:00 PM on a Sunday, staring at a blank GDoc." |
| **2. The Internal Monologue** | Taking the thought right out of their head. | "I'm a fraud. Everyone else is shipping, I'm just planning." |
| **3. The Diagnostic Hook** | The "Quiz" frame. | "Take this 60s quiz to see if you have 'Planner's Paralysis'." |
| **4. The Scalable Release** | What they get (PDF/Video) without you. | "Get the 3-step 'Unstuck' checklist (PDF)." |

## 3. The Specialist Masquerade (For Generalists)

If you are a Generalist (Slashie):

1. **Do NOT** sell your breadth ("I do everything").
2. **DO** masquerade as a specialist for the specific problem in the content.
3. *Example*: For the duration of this post, I am not a "Creative Director." I am a "Specialist in fixing Sunday Night Writer's Block."

## 4. The Funnel Logic

* **Top (Content)**: Agitate the "Stuck Moment."
* **Middle (Quiz/Lead Magnet)**: Filter "Nos" from "Yeses."
  * *No*: Send PDF (Zero Cost).
  * *Maybe*: Send Email Sequence (Low Cost).
  * *Yes*: Send Calendar Link (High Cost).
* **Bottom (Sales)**: Only talk to "Yeses."

## 5. Execution Checklist

- [ ] Does this describe the problem better than the user can?
* [ ] Is there a specific "Time and Place" anchor (The 11 PM Rule)?
* [ ] Is the CTA a *diagnostic* ("Find out X") rather than a *pitch* ("Buy Y")?
