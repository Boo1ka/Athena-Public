# Protocol 033: The Principal-Agent Problem

> **Source**: Economics / Game Theory  
> **Domain**: Incentives / Strategy  
> **Priority**: ⭐⭐⭐ Critical

## Core Principle

> **"Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome." — Charlie Munger**

The **Principal-Agent Problem** occurs when one person (the **Principal**) authorizes another (the **Agent**) to act on their behalf, but their interests do not align.

* **Principal**: Wants maximum value/efficiency. Bearer of Risk.
* **Agent**: Wants maximum fee/comfort. Bearer of Zero Risk.

---

## 2. The Misalignment Mechanics

### A. Information Asymmetry

The Agent knows more about the task than the Principal.

* *Example*: Mechanic (Agent) knows the car only needs a $10 screw, but tells the Owner (Principal) it needs a $500 overhaul.

### B. Moral Hazard

The Agent takes risks because the Principal bears the cost.

* *Example*: Banker gambles with depositors' money. If win -> Bonus. If lose -> Bailout (Depositors lose).

## 3. Sovereign Application (The Tuition Trap)

This explains the **Tuition Industry** (and "Unit Trusts"):

1. **You (Principal)** want: Financial Freedom / Smart Kid.
2. **Agent (Tutor/Banker)** wants: Recurring Fees.
3. **Conflict**: If the kid gets smart fast, the Tutor loses a client. The Tutor is *incentivized* to prolong the dependency.

### The Fix: Skin in the Game

You must force the Agent to share the Risk.

* *Bad Contract*: "I pay you $50/hr." (Incentive: Go slow).
* *Sovereign Contract*: "I pay you $20/hr, plus $500 bonus for every 'A' grade." (Incentive: Results).
