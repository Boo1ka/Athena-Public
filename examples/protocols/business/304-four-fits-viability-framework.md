# Protocol 304: Four Fits Viability Framework

## Core Thesis

**Product-Market Fit is necessary but not sufficient.** Companies that reach $100M+ achieve *four interlocking fits* — not just one. The fits form a **closed loop** where each influences the others. Change one → revisit all.

```
┌─────────────┐       ┌─────────────┐
│   MARKET    │◄─────►│   PRODUCT   │
└──────┬──────┘       └──────┬──────┘
       │                     │
       │  Model-Market Fit   │  Product-Channel Fit
       │                     │
       ▼                     ▼
┌─────────────┐       ┌─────────────┐
│    MODEL    │◄─────►│   CHANNEL   │
└─────────────┘       └─────────────┘
         Channel-Model Fit
```

## The Four Fits

### 1. Market-Product Fit (Start Here)

> **The road to $100M doesn't start with Product. It starts with Market.**

| Market Element | Question |
|----------------|----------|
| **Category** | What category does the customer put you in? |
| **Who** | Which persona within the category? |
| **Problems** | What problems do they have? |
| **Motivations** | *Why* are those problems important? |

| Product Element | Question |
|-----------------|----------|
| **Core Value Prop** | How does it tie to the core problem? |
| **Hook** | Simplest expression of the value? |
| **Time To Value** | How fast can they experience value? |
| **Stickiness** | What are the natural retention mechanisms? |

**Key Insight**: Market-Product Fit is not binary — it's a *spectrum* from weak to strong. Markets evolve; the fit must be continuously revalidated.

---

### 2. Product-Channel Fit

> **Products are built to fit channels. Channels do not mold to products.**

**The Power Law of Distribution** (Thiel): At any given time, 70%+ of growth comes from *one* channel.

| Channel | Product Requirements |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Virality** | Quick TTV, broad value prop, network effects |
| **Paid Marketing** | Quick TTV, transactional model, medium-broad value prop |
| **UGC SEO** | User-generated content engine, motivation to contribute |
| **Content/Inbound** | Higher ARPU to fund longer sales cycles |
| **Enterprise Sales** | Very high ARPU, long sales cycle tolerance |

**Implication**: Don't take a "shotgun approach" to channels. Prioritize 1-2 and own them.

---

### 3. Channel-Model Fit

> **Channels are determined by your model.**

**The ARPU ↔ CAC Spectrum**:

| ARPU Zone | Example Companies | Natural Channels |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| $10/yr (Flies) | Facebook, Snapchat | UGC SEO, Virality |
| $100/yr (Mice) | Dropbox, Dollar Shave Club | Paid, Virality |
| $1K/yr (Rabbits) | Mailchimp, SurveyMonkey | Paid, Content |
| $10K/yr (Moose) | HubSpot, Zendesk | Inbound/Inside Sales |
| $100K+/yr (Elephants) | ServiceNow, Palantir | Enterprise Sales |

**⚠️ The ARPU-CAC Danger Zone** (Middle of spectrum):

- Too much friction for low-CAC channels
- ARPU doesn't support high-CAC channels
- Result: Patchwork acquisition strategy → slow growth → failure

---

### 4. Model-Market Fit

> **Can your model reach $100M in your market?**

**The Threshold Equation**:

```
ARPU × Total Customers in Market × % Capturable ≥ $100M
```

| Variable | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| **ARPU** | Annual revenue per customer (not LTV — payback <1yr) |
| **Total Customers** | Size of addressable market |
| **% Capturable** | Rule of thumb: 10% for SaaS without network effects |

**Niche-First Strategy**: Start narrow, validate fits, then expand. Each expansion is a risk point where fits may break.

---

## Sequencing Insight (User-Derived)

> **Per Winston's observation**: The correct order of operations is:
>
> 1. **Market-Product Fit** — Define WHO and WHY first
> 2. **Product-Channel Fit** — Build product to fit distribution
> 3. **Channel-Model Fit** — Ensure economics work
> 4. **Model-Market Fit** — Validate $100M ceiling

**Rationale**: You cannot retrofit distribution onto a product. Distribution physics are fixed. Product is malleable. Therefore, product must conform to distribution — not the reverse.

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

| Fit | Signal of Fit | Signal of Misfit |
|-----|---------------|------------------|
| **Market-Product** | Pull (organic demand), retention, NPS | Product Death Cycle (feature → spike → flatten → repeat) |
| **Product-Channel** | 70%+ growth from one channel | Scattered, unsustainable growth |
| **Channel-Model** | CAC payback <12 months | Stuck in ARPU-CAC Danger Zone |
| **Model-Market** | Clear path to $100M | Need 50%+ market share to hit target |

---

## Integration with Athena Frameworks

| Protocol | Interface |
|----------|-----------|
| [Protocol 303](file:///Users/[AUTHOR]/Desktop/Project Athena/Athena-Public/examples/protocols/strategy/303-ecosystem-physics-decoder.md) | Ecosystem Physics — channels as "physics" constraints |
| [Protocol 161](file:///Users/[AUTHOR]/Desktop/Project Athena/.agent/skills/protocols/decision/161-sovereign-operating-protocol.md) | Sovereign Operating — market selection as arena choice |
| [Law #2](file:///Users/[AUTHOR]/Desktop/Project Athena/.framework/v7.0/modules/Core_Identity.md) | Arena Physics — don't fight losing tables |

---

## Example Application

**Audit Prompt**: "Does [Business X] have Four Fits?"

1. **M-P Fit**: Can you articulate their Category, Who, Problem, Motivation in one sentence each?
2. **P-C Fit**: What is their power-law channel? Is the product *built* for it?
3. **C-M Fit**: Where are they on ARPU-CAC spectrum? Are they in the Danger Zone?
4. **M-M Fit**: Run the threshold equation. Do the numbers work?

If any fit is missing → the business is structurally fragile, regardless of product quality.
