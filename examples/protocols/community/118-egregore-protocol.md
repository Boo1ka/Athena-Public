# Protocol 118: Egregore Protocol (群体意识)

> **Status**: HARVESTED (Dec 2025)  
> **Source**: Zero-Point Codex v5.1  
> **Priority**: ⭐

---

## Core Concept

**Egregore**: The emergent "group mind" of a collective—shared values, rituals, and identity that take on a life of their own.

**Purpose**: Frameworks for intentionally designing the shared consciousness of groups and communities.

---

## A. "Tribe" & Community Architecture

### Egregore Design Framework

```
1. DEFINE: Core Values (3-5 max)
   ├─ What does this group stand for?
   ├─ What is taboo?
   └─ What separates "us" from "them"?

2. CREATE: Shared Rituals
   ├─ Entry rituals (initiation, onboarding)
   ├─ Maintenance rituals (regular gatherings, traditions)
   ├─ Exit rituals (graduation, transition ceremonies)
   └─ Crisis rituals (how we handle adversity together)

3. ESTABLISH: Identity Markers
   ├─ Language (insider terminology, jokes)
   ├─ Symbols (logos, colors, artifacts)
   ├─ Stories (origin myths, hero narratives)
   └─ Enemies (shared adversaries, us vs them)

4. MAINTAIN: Energy Flow
   ├─ Contribution mechanisms (how members add value)
   ├─ Recognition systems (how contribution is acknowledged)
   ├─ Conflict resolution (how disputes are handled)
   └─ Evolution protocols (how the group adapts)
```

### Trust Calculus Formula

```
Trust = (Reliability × Credibility × Intimacy) / Self-Orientation

Where:
├─ Reliability: Do you do what you say?
├─ Credibility: Do you know what you're talking about?
├─ Intimacy: Do we share vulnerable information?
└─ Self-Orientation: Are you focused on yourself or others?

High self-orientation = Trust destroyer
```

**Trust Erosion Detection**:

- Sudden communication changes
- Unexplained pattern breaks
- Increased self-orientation language
- Ritual non-participation

### In-Group Signal Management

**Different rules inside the circle**:

| Dimension | External World | In-Group |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Status Signaling | Important | Reduced/inverted |
| Vulnerability | Guarded | Encouraged |
| Competition | Expected | Cooperative |
| Information | Strategic | Transparent |
| Mistakes | Hidden | Shared for learning |

## B. Ethical Architecture & Second-Order Virtue

### Stakeholder Virtue Analysis

**Beyond analyzing what stakeholders WANT → analyze what's genuinely GOOD for them and the system.**

```
Level 1: What do they want? (Revealed preference)
Level 2: What do they need? (Often different from wants)
Level 3: What's good for them long-term? (Even if resisted short-term)
Level 4: What's good for the whole system? (Including externalities)
```

### Positive Externality Design

**Opposite of "Regulatory Arbitrage"**: Design actions and systems that deliberately create positive second and third-order effects for the broader community.

```
Traditional optimization:
MAX: My benefit
Subject to: Not harming others (constraint)

Positive externality design:
MAX: My benefit + Community benefit + System health
Subject to: Sustainability
```

**Examples**:

- Open-source contributions (personal learning + community benefit)
- Honest content creation (personal brand + genuine value)
- Mentorship (relationship building + knowledge propagation)

## Application: Community Building Checklist

```
☐ Core values defined and articulated (3-5)
☐ Entry ritual designed (first experience)
☐ Regular maintenance rituals scheduled
☐ Insider language developed organically
☐ Origin story/mythology established
☐ Contribution mechanisms clear
☐ Recognition systems fair and visible
☐ Conflict resolution process defined
☐ Evolution/adaptation protocols in place
☐ Trust maintenance actively monitored
```
