# Protocol 282: Authority Framing (The Mechanism-First Standard)

> **Purpose**: To transition from "Commodity Vendor" (selling results) to "Category Authority" (selling unique mechanisms).
> **Core Mechanic**: Diagnose the *Mechanism of Action*, do not just promise the *Result*.

## 1. The Core Shift

| Dimension | 🔴 Commodity Vendor (Red Zone) | 🟢 Category Authority (Green Zone) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Focus** | **The Result** ("How to fix X") | **The Mechanism** ("Why X happens") |
| **Stance** | Asking Permission ("Please hire me") | Diagnosing Pathology ("You have this specific problem") |
| **Differentiation**| "Better/Faster/Cheaper" | "Different Mechanism / Counter-Intuitive" |
| **Hook** | "Get 10k leads" | "Why your lead gen is structurally broken" |

## 2. The Decision Matrix (Pre-Flight Audit)

Before drafting ANY content (Ad, Article, Landing Page), run this audit:

| Check | Question | Pass Condition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Problem Definition** | Are we defining the problem the same way as everyone else? | ❌ Must **re-frame** the problem. (e.g., "Latency" → "Lazy Logic") |
| **The Solution** | Is the solution a commodity (tool/tactic)? | ❌ Must be a **proprietary mechanism** or **protocol**. |
| **The Evidence** | Is it generic stats or "Trust me"? | ❌ Must be **N=1 System Data** or **Case Study**. |
| **Locus of Authority** | Are we teaching or selling? | ❌ Must feel like a **Doctor's Diagnosis**, not a Sales Pitch. |

## 3. The "Vocabulary vs. Grammar" Heuristic

Use this mental model to separate "Information" from "Insight":

- **Vocabulary (Static)**: The "What". Definitions, syntax, tools. Scalable, low value. (e.g., "How to run a Facebook Ad")
- **Grammar (Dynamic)**: The "How". Timing, pattern recognition, judgment. Unscalable, high value. (e.g., "When to kill an ad set based on subtle cues")

**Rule**: We sell **Grammar**, not Vocabulary.

## 4. The "Insight Decay" Guard

> **Warning**: Today's "Unique Spin" is tomorrow's "Commodity Wisdom".

- **Review Cycle**: Every 6 months.
- **Action**: If a mechanism becomes mainstream, it is deprecated. We must invent the *next* frame.

## 5. Implementation in Content (The 3-Part Cluster)

1. **The Symptoms (Diagnosis)**: "You think you have [Common Problem], but you actually have [Root Cause]."
2. **The Mechanism (Theory)**: "Here is the technical/structural reason why the Common Solution fails."
3. **The Implementation (Proof)**: "Here is exactly how we solved it (N=1 Data)."
