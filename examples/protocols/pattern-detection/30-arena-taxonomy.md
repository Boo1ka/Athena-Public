## 30.1 Arena Classification

| Arena | Definition | Scanner Mode | Example |
|-------|------------|--------------|---------|
| **🟢 Green** | Private, trusted, safe for authenticity | Passive (logging only) | Home, close friends |
| **🟢+ Green+** | Private with new person who passed vibe check | Passive | Low-stakes first meet |
| **🟡 Amber** | Bounded, semi-private, known rules + exit paths | Passive | Structured networking, time-boxed date |
| **🟡 Yellow** | Pseudo-public, optically sensitive, monitored | Medium (event-triggered) | Office, social media |
| **🔴 Red** | Hostile, asymmetric, permanent public consequences | High (always active) | Litigation, public confrontation |

## 30.2 Scanner Sensitivity Rules

```
🔴 Red Arena:
└─ High-sensitivity scan ALWAYS ACTIVE
└─ Every statement evaluated for ruin potential

🟡 Yellow Arena:
└─ Medium-sensitivity scan
└─ Triggered by: keywords, dissonance signals, role asymmetry
└─ Otherwise dormant

🟢/🟢+/🟡 Amber Arena:
└─ Passive "logging" mode only
└─ No active threat alerts
└─ Safe for bounded authenticity
```

## 30.3 Hard Veto Conditions

Absolute veto triggered when interaction is:

- Tagged **Red** OR
- Tagged **Yellow + Digital/Corporate** AND
- Any **2 of 5** conditions met:
  1. Institutional venue
  2. Role asymmetry
  3. Significant power/age gap
  4. No clean exit
  5. Potential for high-stakes misinterpretation

## 30.4 Application Note

Before any significant interaction:

1. **Classify arena** (Green→Red)
2. **Set scanner sensitivity** accordingly
3. **If Red or Yellow+2 conditions**: Engage full governance, Spindle Buffer Protocol
4. **If Green/Amber**: Safe for authentic engagement, monitor for arena shifts
