# Protocol: Content Publication Standard

> **Purpose**: Unified standard for all high-value writing across formats (Medium, Portfolio, Blog).
> **Triggers**: Writing any public-facing article, case study, or report.

---

## 1. Universal Standards (Applying to ALL Formats)

### 1.1 AI Slop Prevention (The "Human-First" Pass)

- **Forbidden Starters**: "In today's fast-paced world...", "Imagine a world where...", "In the realm of...".
- **AI Tells**: High frequency of "revolutionary", "game-changer", "basically", "very", "really".
- **Pass Rule**: Every draft must include at least one concrete micro-story (scenario + constraint + outcome) and one artifact (table/code snippet/checklist).

### 1.2 Credibility & Capability Boundaries

- **Claim Rule**: Never cite "studies show" without naming the source. If unsupported, label as a "hypothesis" or "personal observation".
- **Demo Boundary**: If describing an automated workflow, include a link to the repo or pseudocode to prove it isn't "vibe-ware".

### 1.3 Tone & Voice

- **Stance**: Confident but skeptical of hype. Systems thinking over magic.
- **POV**: First person singular ("I"), except "we" for Winston + Athena.
- **Constraint**: No orphan statistics. Every number must have context or a disclaimer.

### 1.4 Distribution Strategy: Signal Density (The "Anti-Volume" Law)

- **Rule**: Do not post for the sake of "feeding the algorithm." If you have nothing novel to say, stay silent.
- **Metric**: Optimize for **Retention** (Depth of read), not **Reach** (Width of feed).
- **Focus**: Own **ONE** platform (Website/Portfolio) for *Content*. Own **ONE** platform (LinkedIn) for *Discovery*.
- **Mechanism**: Use LinkedIn (Discovery) to *signpost* traffic back to the Core Hub (Authority).

## 2. Platform-Specific Specs (Context Switch)

### [PLATFORM: LINKEDIN] (The Viral Wrapper)

- **Source Protocol**: [Protocol 282](file:///Users/[AUTHOR]/Desktop/Project Athena/.agent/skills/protocols/content/282-viral-wrapper.md)
- **Goal**: High-velocity scroll capture -> Deep value delivery.
- **Hook**: First 2 lines MUST trigger the "See more" click. Use the "Allen Wang" types (Contrast, Reveal, Turn).
- **Visuals**: Mandatory Group Photo or Visual Asset. Text-only is dead.
- **Structure**: Hook -> Context (The "Why") -> Insight (The "What") -> The Asset (The "How").
- **Constraint**: **The Sellout Check** — If you cringe reading it aloud, rewrite the hook.

### [PLATFORM: MEDIUM]

- **Target**: Boost-eligible discovery engine (Secondary).
- **Hook**: Start *in medias res*. No preamble. Point of the story within first 15%.
- **Structure**: Outcome → Core Insight → 2 Concrete Examples → Limitations → Stealable Asset → CTA.
- **Metadata**: Title (6-10 words, intrigue), Subtitle (concrete benefit), SEO Desc (140-156 chars).
- **Image**: 16:9 Landscape. Metaphor over technology (Avoid "glowing brains").

### [PLATFORM: PORTFOLIO / HTML]

- **Target**: Permanent credibility asset + Recruiter landing page.
- **Structure**: Executive Summary (Problem/Solution/Outcome) → Table of Contents → 7 Sections Max → Limits/Risks → Next Steps/CTA.
- **Technical**: Semantic HTML5, JSON-LD Schema (BlogPosting), Canonical URL, Open Graph tags.
- **Artifacts**: Maximize tables and figures. Every 300 words must have a visual breaks.

### [PLATFORM: CASE STUDY]

- **Structure**: Landscape Analysis (Macro) → Business Audit (Micro) → Synthesis (TOWS) → Roadmap (Deliverables).
- **Enforcement**: Disclose all assumptions. Add "not financial/legal advice" disclaimer.

## 3. Pre-Publish Quality Rubric (Self-Score 0-2)

1. **Specificity**: Has micro-story + artifact? (0/1/2)
2. **Mechanism**: Explain how/why, not just vibes? (0/1/2)
3. **Tone**: Free of AI-slop phrases? (0/1/2)
4. **Metadata**: Complete and platform-optimized? (0/1/2)

**Target: 7/8 before publication.**
