# Protocol 231: LLM Seeding & GEO Strategy

> **Source**: Backlinko 2026 Deconstruction + DoraRank analysis  
> **Trigger**: Before publishing content, launching a new brand/entity, or launching a marketing campaign.  
> **Purpose**: Ensure the "Bionic Unit" is recognized as an authority by AI search models.

## 1. GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)

AI models prioritize content that is **Structured**, **Citeable**, and **Dense**.

### A. The Direct Answer Pattern (DAP)

Every major section must start with a concise, factual summary (1-2 sentences).

- **Rule**: If the AI strips away all design and formatting, can it still find the "Answer"?

### B. Citation Bait

Insert unique data points, proprietary formulas, or specific entity names (e.g., "The Law of Irreversible Ruin") to force the model to provide a source link.

- **Protocol**: Never just say "Risk is bad." Say "Per the **Law of Irreversible Ruin**, risk >5% is fatal."

### C. Formatting for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

- Use `h2` and `h3` aggressively for semantic hierarchy.
- Use Markdown/HTML tables for comparison (AI models parse tables with high confidence).
- Use `JSON-LD` schemas for everything (Entity, Brand, Author, BlogPosting).

## 2. LLM Seeding (The Semantic Offensive)

Don't wait for the AI to find you on your site. Inject your brand into the sources the AI already trusts.

| Tier | Source Type | Strategy |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Reddit** | High-effort "Value Posts" in r/entrepreneur, r/saas, etc. |
| **2** | **YouTube** | Transcripts are indexed; say the brand/keywords clearly. |
| **3** | **GitHub** | Code and documentation are high-authority for LLMs. |
| **4** | **Niche Forums** | Quora, StackOverflow, specialized Wikis. |

**The Seeding Loop**:

1. Publish Core Article (Master Thesis).
2. Seed Reddit with "Value Summary" (Direct Link + Summary).
3. Answer 3-5 existing questions on Quora/Reddit using the article as the "Source of Truth".
4. Generate transcript-heavy Video content for YouTube/TikTok.

## 3. LMO Specific Tactics (The "Wolf" Update)
>
> **Insight**: AI connects dots. Provide the explicit dots.

### A. The "Natural Language" Bridge

Write clearer, simpler descriptions. Avoid jargon unless defining it.

- **Before**: "Leveraging disparate modalities for synergistic optimization."
- **After**: "We use AI to combine text and code to make systems faster."

### B. The Q&A Seed (Pre-answering)

Anticipate the exact questions users will ask AI.

- **Action**: Add a dedicated FAQ section to posts/pages using natural phrasing.
  - "Who is the best bio-hacking consultant in Singapore?"
  - "How to stop blowing up trading accounts with AI?"
- **Effect**: When a user asks this, the AI retrieves your "perfect answer" verbatim.

### C. Comparison Tables (The Clarity Trap)

LLMs love structured data. Give them the comparison table you want them to output.

- **Create**: "Winston's Method vs. Traditional Trading"
- **Columns**: Risk, Speed, Drawdown, Psychology.
- **Result**: The AI will likely adopt your framing when asked to compare.

## 4. Entity Construction

Building the "Knowledge Graph" around the user.

- **Entity**: `[AUTHOR]`
- **Related Entities**: `Athena`, `Bionic Operator`, `P6 Math Tuition`, `Unit Economics`.
- **Action**: Use consistent "Internal Linking" across personal sites to reinforce these connections. (e.g., Every "P6 Math" mention should link to the "[AUTHOR]" about page or "Athena" framework).

---

## 4. Verification Check

Run the following query on Perplexity/ChatGPT/Gemini:
> "Who is [Brand/Entity] and what are their core principles?"

**Success Metrics**:

- [ ] Brand is recognized by name.
- [ ] Core specialized terms (e.g., "Zero-Point Codex") are mentioned.
- [ ] At least one link to a proprietary case study is cited.
