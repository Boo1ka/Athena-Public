# Protocol 119: First Principles Decomposition (Musk Method)

> **Source**: Zero-Point Codex  
> **Domain**: Business / Analysis  
> **Priority**: ⭐ Standard

---

## Core Principle

> **Break any goal down to its molecular/physical level, identify markup layers, attack the largest removable markups, then rebuild from first principles.**

This is cost archaeology—finding where value leaks and plugging the holes.

---

## The 5-Step Method

### Step 1: Identify True Goal (Real vs. Stated)

```
Questions:
├─ "What does user SAY they want?"
├─ "What do their ACTIONS optimize for?" (Revealed Preference)
├─ "If I gave them the stated goal for free, would they take it?"

If Mismatch > 20% → Stop. Find real goal first.
```

### Step 2: Decompose to Molecular Level

```
Question: "What is this goal at the physics/chemistry level?"

Examples:
├─ "Nutritious meal" → Protein molecules + Vitamins + Minerals
│   └─ Base cost: Amino acids, micronutrients (commodity pricing)
├─ "Employability" → Skill proof (portfolio) + Network
│   └─ Base cost: GitHub (free) + Projects + LinkedIn
├─ "Relationship" → Oxytocin bonding + Mutual attraction
│   └─ Base cost: Shared time + Emotional disclosure + Compatibility
└─ "Learning" → Neural pathway formation
    └─ Base cost: Focused attention + Deliberate practice

Bottom-Up Question: "What's the physical minimum requirement?"
```

### Step 3: Map Current Cost Structure (Markup Archaeology)

```
Physical Minimum Cost: $X
Current Market Cost: $Y
Markup Ratio: Y/X = ___

Decompose Markup Into:
├─ Retail markup: ___% (removable via bulk)
├─ Rent/Admin: ___% (fixed cost, can subsidize)
├─ Labor: ___% (reducible via process design)
├─ Marketing: ___% (removable if pay-for-results)
├─ Regulatory: ___% (policy choice)
└─ Monopoly rent: ___% (artificial scarcity)

Identify: Which components are PHYSICAL (unavoidable) vs POLICY (removable)?
```

### Step 4: Attack Vectors (Prioritize Largest Markups)

```
Rank markup components by:
├─ Size (% of total cost)
├─ Removability (easy vs hard)
└─ Impact (affects quality or just price?)

Attack Priority: Largest + Easy to Remove + High Impact

Examples:
├─ Budget Meal: Retail markup (77%) → Bulk purchasing centers
├─ SkillsFuture: Provider revenue decoupled from outcome → ISA model
├─ Housing: Land cost (artificial) → Release land supply
└─ Healthcare: Drug pricing (monopoly) → Bulk purchasing
```

### Step 5: Reconstruct from First Principles

```
New Cost Structure (Optimized):
├─ Raw materials: $X (physical, unavoidable)
├─ Optimized admin: $Y (minimized)
├─ Efficient process: $Z (redesigned)
└─ Total: $X + $Y + $Z (approaches physical limit)

Verify Economic Viability:
├─ Supplier profit: Sustainable? (>10% net)
├─ User cost: Affordable? (within budget)
├─ Government subsidy: Minimized? (attack input not output)
└─ Incentive alignment: All parties benefit? (>60/100 alignment score)

If any fails → Redesign, don't proceed ⛔
```

## Input vs Output Subsidy Matrix

| Approach | Mechanism | Provider Incentive | Quality | Sustainability | Cost |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|---------|----------------|------|
| **Mandate Output** ❌ | "Sell X at price Y" (no subsidy) | Sacrifice quality to survive | Collapse | Unsustainable | Gov: $0 (but system fails) |
| **Output Subsidy** 🟡 | Pay provider per unit sold | Maximize volume, ignore outcomes | Medium | Medium | Gov: High (pay for activity) |
| **Input Subsidy** ✅ | Subsidize expensive inputs + rent | Maintain quality, sustainable profit | High | High | Gov: Low (bulk savings) |
| **Outcome Subsidy** ✅✅ | Pay only for verified outcomes (ISA) | Maximize outcomes | Highest | Highest | Gov: Medium-Low (only pay for success) |

---

## Decision Tree

```
Government wants outcome X at affordable price
    ↓
Q1: Can providers profitably supply X at target price?
├─ Yes → No intervention needed ✅
└─ No → Continue to Q2

Q2: Why is cost too high?
├─ Expensive inputs → Input subsidy (bulk purchase)
├─ High fixed costs → Rent/admin subsidy
├─ Inefficient process → Provide optimization templates
└─ No quality incentive → Pay-for-results

Q3: Can we measure outcomes?
├─ Yes → Outcome subsidy (ISA model) ✅✅
└─ No → Input subsidy (attack largest cost driver) ✅

NEVER: Mandate output price without subsidy ⛔
Result: Quality collapse, malicious compliance, system failure
```

## Global Case Study Matrix

| Policy | Type | Result |
|--------|------|--------|
| Singapore Budget Meal | Mandate Output ❌ | 0/40 nutrition compliance |
| Singapore SkillsFuture | Output Subsidy 🟡 | 20% employment rate, provider revenue decoupled |
| US Coding Bootcamp (ISA) | Outcome Subsidy ✅✅ | 75-85% employment, incentives aligned |
| German Apprenticeship | Input Subsidy + Employer Co-Design ✅ | 85-90% employment |
| Venezuela Price Controls | Mandate Output ❌ | Shortages, black market, collapse |
| Nordic Healthcare | Input Subsidy (Drug Bulk Purchase) ✅ | High quality, sustainable |

## Application Template

```
Goal: [State the objective]

Step 1: True Goal
├─ Stated: [What they say]
├─ Revealed: [What actions show]
└─ Gap: [%]

Step 2: Molecular Decomposition
├─ Physical requirement: [List components]
└─ Base cost: $[X]

Step 3: Markup Archaeology
├─ Current cost: $[Y]
├─ Markup ratio: [Y/X]
├─ Breakdown:
│   ├─ Retail: [%]
│   ├─ Admin: [%]
│   ├─ Labor: [%]
│   ├─ Marketing: [%]
│   └─ Monopoly: [%]
└─ Removable vs Physical: [ratio]

Step 4: Attack Vector
├─ Largest removable: [component]
├─ Method: [intervention]
└─ Expected savings: [%]

Step 5: Reconstructed Model
├─ New total cost: $[Z]
├─ Provider margin: [%]
├─ User affordability: [Yes/No]
└─ Incentive alignment: [score/100]

Step 6: AI/LLM Execution Strategy (The Feedback Loop)
> "You cannot just throw a big task at it. Give the big picture, break it down, work on small chunks. Feedback-reiterate."

1.  **Decompose**: Give AI the "Molecular Goal" (Step 2).
2.  **Chunk**: Ask for 3-5 sub-tasks (not the whole solution).
3.  **Execute**: Run one chunk.
4.  **Feedback**: Review output, correct trajectory.
5.  **Reiterate**: Proceed to next chunk with updated context.
