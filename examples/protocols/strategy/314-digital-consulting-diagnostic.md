# Protocol 314: The Digital Doctor (Consulting Diagnostic)

> **Purpose**: To correctly diagnose a client's business bottleneck *before* pitching a marketing solution. Prevents "Malpractice" (selling ads to a capped business).
> **Prerequisite**: Use before [Strategic Analysis Framework (Strategic Analysis)](file:///Users/[AUTHOR]/Desktop/Project Athena/.agent/skills/protocols/strategy/Strategic_Analysis_Framework.md).

## 1. The Core Principle

**"Prescription without Diagnosis is Malpractice."**
> Never sell "Digital Marketing" (the drug) until you know if the ailment is Visibility, Trust, or Capacity.

## 2. The Critical Trap: The Supply-Constraint Fallacy

* **The Error**: Selling Lead Generation (Ads) to a service provider who is already at 100% capacity during peak hours.
* **The Result**: You create a backlog, stress the client, and destroy their reputation.
* **The Fix**: Determine "Solo vs. Scalable" first.

## 3. The 3-Question Diagnostic

Run this script in the first meeting to categorize the client.

| Q | Question Script | If Answer A... | If Answer B... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Capacity** | *"If I sent you 10 new students tomorrow, what would happen?"* | **"I'd panic/No slots."**<br>Diagnosis: **Capacity Constraint**.<br>*Action*: Sell Yield/Automation. | **"I'd take them all!"**<br>Diagnosis: **Demand Constraint**.<br>*Action*: Sell Ads/SEO. |
| **2. Friction** | *"When people don't sign up, what is the usual reason?"* | **"They ghost me/No reply."**<br>Diagnosis: **Sales Friction**.<br>*Action*: Sell Automation/Booking. | **"They say I'm too expensive."**<br>Diagnosis: **Value Gap**.<br>*Action*: Sell Branding/Web. |
| **3. Mirror** | *"Google yourself right now. Are you happy with what you see?"* | **"I don't exist."**<br>Diagnosis: **Invisibility**.<br>*Action*: Sell SEO/Content. | **"It's an old/ugly page."**<br>Diagnosis: **Trust Deficit**.<br>*Action*: Sell Revamp. |

## 4. The 3 Client Buckets (The Prescription)

Once diagnosed, slot the client into **one** bucket. Do not sell mixed packages until Phase 2.

### Bucket A: "The Ghost" (Invisible but Good)

* **Symptom**: "I'm great at what I do, but nobody knows I exist."
* **The Cure**: **The Visibility Package**.
* **Components**: SEO + Content Repurposing + Google Business Profile.

### Bucket B: "The Leaky Bucket" (Visible but Untrusted)

* **Symptom**: "People visit my page but don't enquire." OR "I get leads but they are low quality."
* **The Cure**: **The Trust Package**.
* **Components**: Website Revamp (Sales-focused) + Corporate Branding + "Avengers" Team Profiles.

### Bucket C: "The Hustler" (Hungry & Scalable)

* **Symptom**: "I have junior staff standing around with no work."
* **The Cure**: **The Velocity Package**.
* **Components**: Paid Ads (FB/IG) + Landing Page Funnel.

## 5. Strategic Pivots (Advanced)

* **The "Avengers" Model**: If client is Solo but wants to scale, pitch branding *individual* coaches to de-risk "Founder Dependency."
* **MCDA Prioritization**: If multiple issues exist, rank recommendations by MCDA (Criteria: Budget vs. Speed vs. Impact). *Always fix the Website (Foundation) before buying Ads (Fuel).*
