# Protocol 312: Carousell Listing Min-Max Formula

> **Source**: Tech Maniac + Codingo competitor analysis (Session 17, Jan 2026)  
> **Domain**: Marketing, Marketplace Optimization, Carousell

---

## The Trifecta

Carousell listing optimization has three independent layers. Max each one:

| Layer | Function | Optimization Target |
|-------|----------|---------------------|
| **1. Images** | Scroll-stopper + trust builder | Use all 10 slots, branded footer consistency, visual proof stacking |
| **2. Title/Keywords** | Search indexing (SEO) | Max keyword density (~250 chars), panic terms, school names, tool names |
| **3. Body Copy** | Conversion (sales) | P-C-F-P-C structure: Product → Credibility → Features → Process → CTA |

---

## Layer 1: Images (10 Slots)

**Recommended allocation:**

1. Hero (branding + key value props)
2. Why Choose Me (differentiators)
3. Languages/Tools covered (visual grid)
4. How It Works (numbered steps)
5. Testimonials (client feedback with context)
6. Pricing (tier cards)
7. Guarantee/Trust badges (Turnitin, AI-safe)
8. Scope/Modules covered
9. Contact CTA (WA/Telegram)
10. Trust signals (stats + guarantees)

**Principles:**

- Branded footer consistency across all images
- Dark theme with cyan/gold accents (tech aesthetic)
- Each image serves a distinct conversion function
- Unused slots = wasted real estate

---

## Layer 2: Title/Keywords (~250 chars)

**Structure:**

```
[Emoji] [Service Type] | [Languages/Tools] | [Guarantee] | [Speed] | [Schools] | [Scope]
```

**Example (coding):**

```
💻 Coding & Programming Assignment Help | Python Java C++ SQL HTML CSS JavaScript | SPSS Excel Matlab R Tableau | No Pass = Full Refund | Turnitin AI-Safe | 24/7 Urgent Rush | NUS NTU SMU SUSS SIM Kaplan PSB MDIS Poly | FYP Capstone Data Analytics OOP Web App
```

**High-value keyword categories:**

- Panic terms: `Urgent`, `Rush`, `Last Minute`, `24/7`
- Guarantees: `No Pass = Refund`, `Turnitin Safe`, `AI-Safe`, `GPTZero`
- Schools: `NUS`, `NTU`, `SMU`, `SUSS`, `SIM`, `Kaplan`, `PSB`, `MDIS`, `JCU`, `Poly`
- Tools/Languages: Stack all relevant ones
- Scope: `FYP`, `Capstone`, `Thesis`, `Dissertation`, `TMA`

## Layer 3: Body Copy (P-C-F-P-C)

| Beat | Section | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| **P** | Product | What is it? One-line hook |
| **C** | Credibility | Who are you? (Local Grad, X years, X reviews) |
| **F** | Features | What do I get? (✅ bullet stack) |
| **P** | Process | How does it work? (Numbered steps) |
| **C** | CTA | What do I do now? (Contact + urgency) |

**Additional sections:**

- "Why Not ChatGPT?" (objection pre-emption)
- Competitor callout (position against scammers)
- Pricing tiers (reduce quote anxiety)
- Testimonials with context (Name + School + Outcome)
- SEO tail (hashtags + raw keywords at bottom)

---

## Competitor Patterns Observed

**Tech Maniac (Google One):**

- Enemy framing ("Stop buying fake 'Lifetime' accounts")
- Trust stacking (8000+ reviews, 8 years, 2 accounts)
- Direct payment CTA (PayNow QR in images)
- Branded footer consistency

**Codingo (Assignment Help):**

- Module code targeting (ICT133, CS1010, etc.)
- "Only incorporated company in SG" authority
- TikTok discount for social proof
- Fake account warning (scarcity + legitimacy)
