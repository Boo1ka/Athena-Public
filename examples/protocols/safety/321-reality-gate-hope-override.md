# Protocol 121: The Reality Gate (Anti-Hope Algorithm)

> **Purpose**: A binary circuit breaker designed to bypass the "Hope Override" mechanism. It replaces "Soft Judgment" (Narrative) with "Hard Constraints" (Logic Gates).
> **Trigger**: When the User feels the urge to say "But maybe..." or "Part of me knows it's BS, but..."

## 1. The Core Mechanic: Falsification > Verification

**The Trap**: The brain is an Optimism Engine. It naturally seeks *verification* ("He replied! It works!").
**The Fix**: We must seek *falsification* ("He failed the test. It's dead.").

| Component | Soft Check (Weak) | Reality Gate (Strong) |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| **Input** | "How do I feel about this?" | "Did the Falsifier trigger?" |
| **Criterion** | Intuition / Vibes | Binary Data (Yes/No) |
| **Outcome** | "Let's give it time." | **EXIT.** (No renegotiation). |

## 2. The Four Pillars of the Gate

To execute a Reality Gate, you must define these 4 variables **before** emotional commitment deepens.

### 1. Base Rate Anchor (The Outside View)
>
> *"In this specific arena, what happens to 99% of people?"*

* **Logic**: You are unlikely to be the exception.
* **Application**: If the Base Rate is >90% failure (e.g., Insurance Agency, Limerence Pursuit), the default assumption must be **FAILURE**. Evidence is required to *stay*, not to leave.

### 2. Pre-Committed Falsifiers (The Tripwires)
>
> *"What specific, observable events would prove my fantasy wrong?"*

Define 3 binary falsifiers. If **ANY** triggers, the hypothesis is dead.

* **Relational Example**:
  * F1: "If I initiate >70% of contact for 3 weeks."
  * F2: "If plans are cancelled twice without immediate reschedule."
  * F3: "If I feel drained after 2 consecutive interactions."
* **Business Example**:
  * F1: "If income requires recruiting friends/family."
  * F2: "If I am asked to work for free >2 times."
  * F3: "If the product requires 'Education' to sell (Zero Education Rule)."

### 3. Timebox & Stop-Loss (The Budget)
>
> *"Priced Idealism is R&D. Unpriced Idealism is Ruin."*

* **Timebox**: "I will test this for exactly 14 days." (End Date: YYYY-MM-DD).
* **Stop-Loss**: "I will spend max $500 / 10 hours social energy."
* **Rule**: When the budget hits zero, the project is closed. No extensions.

### 4. Audit Trail (The Anti-Gaslight Ledger)
>
> *"Prevent the Narrative Editor from rewriting history."*

* **Format**: One-page log.
* **Entry**: "Hypothesis: X. Evidence For: A. Evidence Against: B. Decision: C."
* **Effect**: Forces confrontation with the cumulative data trend.

## 3. The Execution Script

**Phase 1: Setup (The Contract)**

1. **Trigger Detected**: "Part of me hopes..."
2. **Define the Gate**: Write down Base Rate, 3 Falsifiers, Timebox, Stop-Loss.
3. **Commit**: "If a trigger hits, I exit. No negotiation."

**Phase 2: Monitoring (The Watch)**

* Run the interaction.
* Log data points (Revealed Preference Ratio).

**Phase 3: The Breach (The Exit)**

* **Event**: Falsifier #2 triggers.
* **System Response**:
  * **Emotional Layer**: "But wait! Maybe he's busy..."
  * **Protocol Layer**: "Falsifier #2 Triggered. Condition Met. EXECUTE EXIT."
* **Action**: Withdraw. Gray Rock. Close Project.

## 4. Implementation Templates

### Relational: "Revealed Preference Ratio"

Track behavioral reciprocity, not vibes.

* **Initiation Ratio**: Who starts? (Target: 40-60%)
* **Follow-Through**: % of promises kept.
* **Repair Rate**: Do they fix what they break?

### Business: "Incentive Tripwire"

Identify who gets paid for what.

* **Red Flag**: Comp depends on recruiting ("Warm Market").
* **Red Flag**: "Training" is hype, not skills.
* **Red Flag**: Pressure to ignore skepticism ("Trust the process").
