## 0. Core Philosophy

> "Think of where your organization's purpose and your customers' pain points meet. That common ground is where you'll find your strategy."

**The Pain Point Mandate**: Every piece of content must solve a specific, real human problem. Generic content = invisible content.

---

## 1. The Three Strategic Modes

Use to qualify clients and scope engagements:

| Mode | Client Situation | Content Focus |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| **START** | Launching new venture/business arm | Visibility, awareness, initial positioning |
| **STRETCH** | Expanding to new markets/segments | Market-specific messaging, localization |
| **STRENGTHEN** | Auditing/improving existing content | Gap analysis, optimization, refresh |

**Application**: Ask "Are you starting, stretching, or strengthening?" to instantly qualify scope.

## 3. The Three Core Principles

### Principle 1: Balance Longevity with Short-Term Impact

> "Vision can only be achieved with sustainable action."

**Application**:

- Track **small/early wins** with practical metrics (traffic, rankings, shares)
- Stay focused on **long-term goals** with content priorities
- Don't sacrifice brand-building for quick wins (or vice versa)

### Principle 2: Tangible Impact on Real Problems

> "People's problems take center stage—on and off the page."

**Application**:

- Map each content asset to a **specific pain point**
- Ground content in **customer reality and aspirations**
- Recognize that both B2B buyers AND the humans doing the job have needs

### Principle 3: Create Content That Sparks Conversation

> "You can't influence those who forget you."

**Application**:

- Content must be **relevant, interesting, AND useful** (not just one)
- Include **authentic insights** from expertise, experience, execution
- The "earned secrets" principle: share what only YOU know

---

## 4. Editorial Excellence Stack

### 4.1 The "Writers + Marketers" Positioning

> "You've worked with agencies who know keywords but can't spell. You've worked with writers who can't tell you where content fits. We're both."

**Steal**: Position at the **intersection** of craft + strategy. Not "just a writer" or "just a strategist."

### 4.2 Interview-Based Content

> "As former journalists, we know how to develop engaging interview questions to get the best insights from subject-matter experts."

**Application**:

- When writing for clients, **interview them** to extract proprietary insights
- This is what AI alone cannot do — makes content unique
- Use journalistic techniques: open questions, follow-ups, "tell me more"

### 4.3 Proven Editorial Process

Elements of professional editorial:

1. **Research** — Industry, competitor, keyword
2. **Outline** — Structure before drafting
3. **Draft** — First version
4. **Internal Edit** — Quality control
5. **Client Review** — Alignment check
6. **Final Polish** — Proofread, optimize

## 6. Content Repurposing Framework

> "After your next webinar, don't toss the recording in the archives. Get it into the hands of more people."

**The Repurposing Cascade**:

```
