# Protocol 124: SDR Diagnosis (Strategic Disadvantage Ratio)

> **Source**: Zero-Point Codex v3.0 / Session 20
> **Domain**: Decision / Arena Selection
> **Priority**: ⭐⭐⭐ Critical

---

## 1. The Core Formula

```math
SDR = \frac{\text{Strategic Gap}}{\text{Tactical Gap}}
```

| Component | Definition | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Strategic Gap** | **"Am I at the right table?"** | Wrong market, wrong credentials, wrong timing. <br>Things you **CANNOT** fix with harder work. |
| **Tactical Gap** | **"Am I playing well at this table?"** | CV quality, interview skills, networking. <br>Things you **CAN** fix with harder work. |

## 2. How to Read It (The Decision Rule)

| SDR Ratio | Failure Type | Meaning | GTO Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **< 2:1** | **A-Type (Variance)** | Winnable game, bad luck. | **Keep Going ✅** (Optimize Execution) |
| **2–5:1** | **Scouting Zone** | Something's off. | **Investigate 🟡** (Audit Assumptions) |
| **> 5:1** | **B-Type (Structural)** | Wrong table entirely. | **Exit Table ❌** (Change Arenas) |

## 3. The Boxer's Fallacy

> **The Deadly Trap (SDR > 5:1)**

When **SDR > 5:1**, most people respond by:

1. More applications (Tactical)
2. Better CV (Tactical)
3. More interview prep (Tactical)
4. **Working HARDER at the WRONG TABLE.**

> *This is like a lightweight boxer "training harder" to beat a heavyweight. The problem isn't effort. The problem is **WEIGHT CLASS**.*

**Result**: Efficient execution of the **WRONG** strategy ☠️.
**The Fix**: The fix isn't "punch harder." The fix is **"change rings."**

## 4. Worked Example: SIT Graduate

**Scenario**: 650 Applications, 0 Offers. Second Upper Honours.

### Step 1: Strategic Gap (Market/Credential Mismatch)

* SIT vs NUS/NTU Perception Gap: **16/20**
* Saturated Entry-Level Market: **14/20**
* Mass Applying vs Pipeline/Referral: **16/20**
* **Average**: **15/20**

### Step 2: Tactical Gap (Execution Quality)

* 650 Applications (Max Effort): **2/20** (Gap is low because effort is high)
* Second Upper Honours (Decent): **4/20**
* Internship Conversion (Capable): **3/20**
* **Average**: **3/20**

### Step 3: Base SDR Calculation

$$ Base SDR = 15 \div 3 = 5:1 $$

### Step 4: Singapore Multipliers

* Credentialism (SIT $\neq$ NUS): **$\times 2.0$**
* Small Market: **$\times 1.5$**
* Foreign Talent Competition: **$\times 1.8$**

### Final Verdict

$$ Adjusted SDR = 5 \times 2.0 \times 1.5 \times 1.8 = \mathbf{27:1} $$

**Diagnosis**: **Extreme B-Type Failure.**
**Action**: This person doesn't need a better CV. They need a **different table** (Geographic Arbitrage, Adjacent Industry, Entrepreneurship).

## 5. Universal Application

SDR applies to any domain where you are repeatedly failing despite effort:

| Domain | Strategic Gap | Tactical Gap | SDR | Diagnosis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Job Hunting** (SIT grad, SG market) | 15/20 | 3/20 | **27:1** | **Wrong Table** (Exit) |
| **Dating** (Wrong market segment) | 12/20 | 4/20 | **3:1** | **Investigate** (Pivot?) |
| **Business** (Saturated niche) | 16/20 | 5/20 | **3:1** | **Investigate** (Pivot?) |
| **Friendship** (Wrong container) | 18/20 | 2/20 | **9:1** | **Wrong Table** (Exit) |

## 6. The Decision Heuristic

**Before optimizing tactics, ALWAYS ask:**

1. **"Am I failing because I'm playing BADLY?"**
    * $SDR < 2:1$ $\rightarrow$ **Yes** $\rightarrow$ Optimize Execution ✅
2. **"Am I failing because I'm at the WRONG TABLE?"**
    * $SDR > 5:1$ $\rightarrow$ **Yes** $\rightarrow$ **CHANGE TABLES** ✅

> *95% of people default to "play harder" when the real answer is "play elsewhere".*
