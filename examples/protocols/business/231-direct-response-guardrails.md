# Protocol 231: The Growth Engine

> **The Offer**: "I will build you a machine that turns $1 into $3."
> **The Condition**: "But only if the math works first."
> **The Pivot**: Move from "Selling Time" (Retainers) to "Selling Money" (ROI).

## 1. The Package (What they buy)

Unlike "Digital Marketing Agencies" that confuse activity with results, we sell a single, closed-loop system.

1. **The Mousetrap (Conversion)**
    * **Single-Page Landing Site**: No "About Us", no fluff.
    * **Structure**: Headline -> VSL/Hero -> Problem/Agitation -> Solution -> Proof -> Offer -> CTA.
    * **Tech**: Hard-coded HTML/Tailwind (Speed) or Framer (Velocity).

2. **The Fuel (Traffic)**
    * **One Channel Only**: Google Search (Intent) OR Facebook/Instagram (Discovery). Never both at start.
    * **3-Creative Test**: We test 3 angles (Logic, Emotion, Scarcity).

## 2. The Verification (The "No Anyhow Bang" Rule)

We do not accept clients who fail the **Unit Economics Test**.

| Check | Formula | Pass Condition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Margin** | Price - COGS | > $50 |
| **Demand** | Keyword Volume | > 1k/month (Google) |
| **Offer** | "Grand Slam" | Solves a bleeding neck problem? |

> **Hard Rule**: If Gross Margin < $30, refuse the project. The ad platforms will eat the profit.

## 3. The Pricing Model (Arbitrage)

Don't charge hourly. Charge for the *installation of the engine*.

* **Setup Fee**: $3,000 - $5,000 (One-time).
  * *Includes*: Landing Page build, Ad Setup, Tracking Pixel.
* **Media Buying**: 15% of Ad Spend (Management) OR $0 if client manages.
* **The Upsell**: "Performance Fee" (10% of generated profit) *after* proven ROI.

## 4. Execution Guardrails

1. **Budget Cap**: Start with $50/day.
2. **Kill Switch**: 3 days with 0 sales = Pause & Pivot.
3. **Scale Rule**: Only increase spend by 20% every 72 hours if CPA < Target.
