# Protocol 265: BOFU Listing Blueprint (Bottom-of-Funnel Conversion)

> **Source**: Carousell Assignment Help listing analysis (January 2026)  
> **Domain**: Marketplace listings, high-intent traffic, lead conversion

---

## Context

Bottom-of-funnel (BOFU) buyers are **high-intent, low-patience**. They've already searched; they're comparing options. The job is *conversion*, not education.

This protocol applies to:

- Carousell/marketplace listings
- Landing pages for search traffic
- DM sales (cold outreach responses)

## The 8-Step BOFU Formula

| Order | Element | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **1** | **Hook** | Straight to the point: "You got a problem? Here's how I solve it." |
| **2** | **Contact** | HMU block — WA, Telegram, Portfolio. No scrolling needed. |
| **3** | **Process** | How it works — numbered steps (Send Brief → Quote → Confirm → Deliver) |
| **4** | **Objection Kill** | Pre-empt the elephant ("WHY NOT CHATGPT?") |
| **5** | **Why Me** | Differentiators — Zero Risk, Blitz Speed, Local, Detection-Proof |
| **6** | **Pricing** | Syllabus-tiered, starting prices visible |
| **7** | **Testimonials** | Social proof — verified client feedback |
| **8** | **The Rest** | Subjects covered, schools served, keyword dump for SEO |

## Key Principles

### 1. Value Proposition Upfront

Lead with the **decision criteria**:

- **Price**: What does it cost?
- **Speed**: How fast?
- **Risk Reversal**: What if it fails?

> If they can't answer "Can I afford this?" and "Is it worth my time?" in 3 seconds, they bounce.

### 2. Close First, Explain Later

BOFU traffic already knows what they want. Don't lecture. The CTA should appear **before** the long-form content.

```
❌ Wrong Order: [Long story] → [Features] → [CTA at bottom]
✅ Right Order: [Value Stack] → [CTA] → [Objection Kill] → [Details]
```

### 3. Objection Inoculation (The "Why Not Free?" Kill)

The biggest competitor for any service is **the free alternative** (ChatGPT, DIY, pirated tools). Address it explicitly:

- **Name it**: "Why not ChatGPT? It's free!"
- **Validate it**: "Good question."
- **Dismantle it**: Explain the failure mode in *their* language (e.g., "Professors spot the robot voice", "Turnitin flags 100%").
- **Contrast**: Show why your version solves that failure.

> This is trust-building through honesty. You acknowledged the elephant; now they trust the rest.

### 4. Credentials After Objection

Placing credentials *after* the objection kill signals:

- "I'm confident enough to address your skepticism first."
- Credentials now feel like *proof*, not *selling*.

### 5. Details Are for Scrollers

Most buyers decide fast. The long-form section (pricing tiers, testimonials, process) exists for:

- High-consideration purchases (FYP, thesis)
- Those comparing multiple sellers

## Visual Template (Carousel Slides)

| Slide | Content |
|-------|---------|
| 1 | **Hero**: Service name, 3 bullet value stack, contact buttons, social proof (rating) |
| 2 | **Speed**: "1-Hour Turnaround ⚡" + timer graphic |
| 3 | **Guarantee**: "No Pass = Full Refund" + shield/money-back badge |
| 4 | **Objection Kill**: "Why Not ChatGPT?" → "Here's Why" |
| 5 | **Credentials**: "Local SG Grad \| 100+ Done \| 5.0 Stars" |
| 6-10 | **Details**: Process, pricing, testimonials, subjects covered, schools served |

---

## Failure Modes

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| "About Me" first | Self-absorbed; reader doesn't care yet | Lead with value stack |
| CTA only at bottom | Loses high-intent buyers who decide fast | CTA in first 20% of content |
| Ignoring free alternatives | Leaves objection unaddressed | Name and kill openly |
| Vague pricing | Friction; they DM competitors | Show starting price upfront |
