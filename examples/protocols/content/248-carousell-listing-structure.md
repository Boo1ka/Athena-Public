## Recommended Section Order

| # | Section | Purpose |
|---|---------|---------|
| 1 | **WHY CHOOSE ME** | Lead with value props — hook immediately |
| 2 | **HOW IT WORKS** | Reduce friction — show simple process |
| 3 | **PRICING** | Filter time-wasters + anchor expectations |
| 4 | **TESTIMONIALS** | Social proof while intent is high (3 max) |
| 5 | **WHAT I COVER** | Details for serious buyers |
| 6 | **SUBJECTS** | Skim-able list (comma-separated) |
| 7 | **SCHOOLS/CLIENTS** | Trust signal / credibility |
| 8 | **CTA** | "DM me now for a free quote!" |
| 9 | **SEO KEYWORDS + HASHTAGS** | Invisible to readers, boosts search |

## Key Principles

1. **Front-load value**: WHY before WHAT.
2. **Testimonials before details**: Proof while intent is high, before info walls.
3. **3 testimonials max**: Wall of text = reader fatigue.
4. **Variety in testimonials**: Cover different services (urgent, FYP, coding).
5. **SEO at bottom**: Keyword dump is necessary but ugly — bury it.
6. **Emoji structure**: Use emoji bullets for visual scanning.
7. **Price anchoring**: Show range (From S$X) to set expectations.

## Testimonial Formula

> "[Outcome achieved]. [Specific positive experience]. [Recommendation]."  
> — **[Name], [School] Year [X], [Major]**

**Example:**
> "Urgent last-minute assignment — needed it in 3 hours. He delivered on time and I got an A-. Highly recommended!"  
> — **Sarah H., TP Year 2, Business**

## Platform Constraints (Carousell-Specific)

- No clickable links in description.
- No phone/WhatsApp numbers in description (put in images or username).
- Character limit: ~2000 chars (test before posting).
- 10 images max — use for key selling points + contact info.
- Bumping resets visibility (free every 3 days, paid for priority).
