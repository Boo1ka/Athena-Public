# Protocol 90: Four Fits Diagnostic

> **Source**: Brian Balfour (Reforge), Session 22 synthesis
> **Tags**: #four-fits #pmf #strategy #business-model #diagnostic

---

## Overview

Product-Market Fit alone is a death sentence. All four fits must interlock and reinforce each other. Use this diagnostic to audit any business model—yours or a competitor's.

---

## The Four Fits

| Fit | Question | Death Signal |
|-----|----------|--------------|
| **Product-Market Fit** | Does your product solve a real problem for a viable market? | No one buys. |
| **Product-Channel Fit** | Is your product *built for* your distribution channel? | Acquisition fails. |
| **Channel-Model Fit** | Can your channel economics support your business model? | CAC > LTV. Unit economics collapse. |
| **Model-Market Fit** | Does your pricing match market expectations and purchasing power? | "Stuck in the middle" death zone. |

---

## Diagnostic Matrix

For each fit, score 1-5 (1 = broken, 5 = locked in):

```
Product-Market Fit:    [ ] / 5
Product-Channel Fit:   [ ] / 5
Channel-Model Fit:     [ ] / 5
Model-Market Fit:      [ ] / 5
```

**Interpretation**:

- All 4s or 5s → Viable. Scale.
- Any 2 or below → Fix that fit before scaling.
- Mixed (some 4s, some 2s) → Misalignment will kill you slowly.

## Quick Audit Questions

### 1. Product-Market Fit

- [ ] Do customers actively seek this solution?
- [ ] Does usage grow without heavy prompting?
- [ ] Would customers be disappointed if it disappeared?

### 2. Product-Channel Fit

- [ ] Is the product *inherently shareable* via this channel?
- [ ] Does channel mechanics *enhance* product experience?
- [ ] Would switching channels break the product?

### 3. Channel-Model Fit

- [ ] Is CAC < 1/3 of LTV?
- [ ] Can this channel scale infinitely, or does it cap?
- [ ] Does channel require margin you don't have?

### 4. Model-Market Fit

- [ ] Is pricing in the expected range for this market segment?
- [ ] Are you selling "mice" (many small) or "elephants" (few large)?
- [ ] Can you defend your pricing against commoditization?

## AI Acceleration Factor

> AI collapses all four fits simultaneously.

| Fit | Pre-AI | Post-AI |
|-----|--------|---------|
| **PMF** | "Tutoring works" | AI tutors work *better* and *cheaper* |
| **PCF** | Platform-dependent | Direct-to-consumer via AI interfaces |
| **CMF** | CAC = commission + ads | CAC ≈ $0 (AI-generated content, zero marginal cost) |
| **MMF** | Human rates set floor | AI sets new floor; humans must justify premium |

---

## Case Application: Solo Tutor Audit

| Fit | Score | Diagnosis |
|-----|-------|-----------|
| **PMF** | 3/5 | Product works. But AI alternatives emerging. |
| **PCF** | 2/5 | Agency-dependent. Product not built for channel. |
| **CMF** | 1/5 | CAC (first 2 lessons) > margin. Geography tax kills unit economics. |
| **MMF** | 2/5 | "Stuck in the middle" — neither cheap scale nor premium niche. |

**Verdict**: Structural misalignment. Escape or die slowly.

---

## Escape Vectors (When Fits Are Broken)

| Broken Fit | Fix |
|------------|-----|
| **PMF** | Pivot product or market segment |
| **PCF** | Build product *for* your channel (or change channel) |
| **CMF** | Cut CAC (own distribution) or raise LTV (premium positioning) |
| **MMF** | Pick a lane: Value Dollar (race to bottom) or Brand Machine (premium) |

---

## The Barbell Heuristic

> Never be in the middle.

| Strategy | Execution |
|----------|-----------|
| **Left Side** (Free) | Free content → builds distribution, generates leads |
| **Right Side** (Premium) | High-ticket "Crisis Fixer" → high margin, low volume |
| **DEATH ZONE** (Middle) | Generic tutor at market rate → no distribution, no margin |
