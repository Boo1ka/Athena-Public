# Protocol 303: Ecosystem Physics Decoder (The Pryce Error)

> **Type**: Strategic Heuristic  
> **Purpose**: Prevention of "Game Mismatch" (Playing Chess in a Boxing Ring)  
> **Origin**: Analysis of Kenneth Tiong (Parliament), Pryce (BCS), and Jeremy/Ryan (Social)  
> **Version**: 1.1 (Revised Dec 2025)  
> **Tags**: #strategy #frame-control #situational-awareness #pryce-error #hybrid-arenas

## 1. The Core Theorem: The Pryce Error

The **Pryce Error** is the fatal strategic mistake of **bringing a rulebook from one ecosystem into an ecosystem running on completely different physics.**

> *Pryce (Better Call Saul) thought he was doing a "Corporate Transaction" (Rule of Law, Contracts, Fairness) with Nacho. He was actually in the "Criminal Underworld" (Rule of Might, Leverage, Violence). He tried to call the police on a drug dealer. He almost died.*

### The Three Physics Types (Diagnostic)

Determine what **enforces** outcomes in this arena.

| Physics Type | Enforcement Mechanism | Winning Condition | The Fatal Error |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mechanical Physics** (Logic/Nature) | **Reality** (Math, Gravity, Audited Ledgers) | Accuracy / Reality Alignment | Confusing **Luck** with **Skill** |
| **Social Physics** (Theatre/Politics) | **Audience** (Norms, Reputation, Narrative) | Persuasion / Status / Admiration | Being **"Right"** instead of **"Liked"** |
| **Predatory Physics** (Crime/Coercion) | **Threat** (Violence, Blackmail, Capture) | Dominance / Submission | Appealing to **"Fairness"** |

> [!WARNING]
> **The Mimicry Trap (Wolf in Sheep's Clothing)**
> The most dangerous players operate in **Predatory Physics** while disguised in **Social Physics**.
>
> * *The Trap:* Corporate sociopaths use "Team Player" language (Social) to execute resource extraction (Predatory).
> * *Rule:* If Words = Social (Fairness) but Utility = Predatory (Zero Sum), **Predatory Physics always overrides.**

## 2. Navigational Tools

### Tool A: The Utility Function Decoder (Law #3)

*Assume multi-objective utility.* Ask: What do they want, what do they fear, and what prevents them?

**Case Study: Parliament (Kenneth Tiong vs Chee Hong Tat)**
* **Kenneth's Error**: Treated it as **Mechanical Physics** (Debate logic).
* **Reality**: It was **Social Physics** (Theatre).
* **Chee's Move**: "Stupid question" trap = Status Lowering.
* **The Interaction Cut**:
  * *Bad:* "That's a stupid question." (Emotional reaction = Frame Loss).
  * *Better (Theatrical):* Smile. "Minister, we can play word games, or we can fix the budget. I prefer to fix the budget." (Frame Re-assertion).

**Case Study: The "Hookup" (Jeremy/Ryan)**
* **User's Error**: Treated it as **Social Physics** (Intimacy/Promise).
* **Reality**: It was **Biological/Predatory Physics** (Dopamine extraction).
* **Verification**: Zero investment outside of the act = Zero Relationship Signal.

### Tool B: The Pre-Commitment Device (Truth Serum)

When words are cheap (Social Physics), introduce a **Right-Sized Cost** to test the physics.

* **The Problem**: "Friend" (Kian Chye) says "Yes" to everything (Social Harmony).
* **The Test**: "I'll draft the outline tonight if you add the examples by Friday." (Reciprocity).
* **The Result**: Action = Signal. Silence = Noise.

### Tool C: The Base Rate Audit (Ruin Prevention)

In Mechanical Physics, Volatility often disguises itself as Skill.

* **Rule**: If a strategy can blow up (Ruin), evaluate it by **Probability of Ruin**, not Average Return.
* **Application**: 500% returns in trading usually means *Selling Tail Risk*. The bill comes due eventually (Ergodicity).

### Tool D: The Physics Shift (The Mike Ehrmantraut Maneuver)

Sometimes you cannot win in the current physics. You must force a **Phase Shift**.

* **Scenario**: A "Friend" extracts professional labor for free using Social Physics ("We're buddies!").
* **The Move**: "I'd love to help. My consulting rate is $300/hr. Shall I send a contract?"
* **The Shift**: Forces interaction from **Social** → **Mechanical**.
* **Result**: They either Pay (Win) or Leave (Win).

## 3. Advanced Dynamics: Hybrid Arenas

Most real-world arenas are blended. You must diagnose the **Primary** and **Secondary** physics.

| Context | Primary Physics | Secondary Physics | Phase Change Trigger |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Litigation** | **Predatory** (Bleed opponent) | **Mechanical** (Laws) + **Social** (Jury) | Public exposure shifts it to **Social**. |
| **Office Politics** | **Social** (Reputation) | **Predatory** (Sabotage) | Introduction of Evidence shifts it to **Mechanical**. |
| **Divorce** | **Predatory** (Asset seizure) | **Mechanical** (Family Law) | "For the kids" shifts it to **Social**. |

## 4. Implementation Checklist

Before engaging in any high-stakes interaction:

1. [ ] **Identify Enforcement**: What enforces the outcome here? (Reality, Audience, or Threat?)
2. [ ] **Check for Mimicry**: Is the "Team Player" actually a "Resource Extractor"?
3. [ ] **Choose Posture**:
    * **Engage**: If you have the advantage in this physics.
    * **Phase Shift**: If you are losing, can you introduce a Contract (Mechanical) or Audience (Social) to change the physics?
    * **Exit/Escalate**: If facing Predatory Physics without leverage, **Exit** or **Bring a Bigger Gun (Third Party)**.
