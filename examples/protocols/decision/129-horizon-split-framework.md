# Protocol 129: The Horizon Split (25Y/90D)

> **Source**: Taylor Pearson, "How to Get Focused" / "The End of Jobs"
> **Purpose**: Resolving the tension between long-term meaning and short-term urgency.
> **Type**: Strategic Planning Framework

## 1. The Core Problem: The Middle Ground Purgatory

Most planning fails because it operates in the "Middle Ground":

* **1-Year Goals**: Too far to feel urgent (procrastination).
* **5-Year Plans**: Too rigid for a changing world (blindness to opportunity).
* **Daily Tasks**: Disconnected from meaning (cutting stones vs. building monuments).

**The Solution**: Bimodal Operation. Operate exclusively at **25 Years** (Vision) and **90 Days** (Execution). Eliminate everything in between.

---

## 2. The 25-Year Vision (The Monument)

### Purpose: Motivation & Priming

* **Mechanism 1: Meaning (Vallacher & Wegner)**
  * Short timeframe = "Cutting stone" (Drudgery).
  * Long timeframe = "Building a cathedral" (Purpose).
  * Meaning scales with timeframe.
* **Mechanism 2: Reticular Priming (The Red Car Effect)**
  * Your brain filters 99% of data. A 25-year vision programs the Reticular Activating System (RAS) to spotopportunities relevant to the goal.
  * *Result*: You "get lucky" because you notice doors that were always there.
* **Mechanism 3: Ambitious Spaciousness**
  * 1 Year = Panic ("I'm running out of time").
  * 25 Years = Calm ("I have time to fail, learn, and master").
  * *Result*: You set bigger goals because the fear of immediate failure dissolves.

## 3. The 90-Day North Star (The Sprint)

### Purpose: Urgency & Calibration

* **Mechanism 1: Amara's Law Intersection**
  * *Law*: "We overestimate what we can do in a day and underestimate what we can do in a decade."
  * 90 Days is the intersection where estimation accuracy is highest.
* **Mechanism 2: The 1% Rule**
  * 90 Days = 1% of 25 Years.
  * If you execute 1% of the vision every quarter, the 25-year vision is mathematically inevitable.
* **Mechanism 3: Adaptability (Marc Andreessen)**
  * The world is too complex for 5-year plans.
  * 90 Days allows for "Pivot or Plow" decisions based on real market feedback.
* **Mechanism 4: Manufactured Urgency**
  * Quarterly deadlines drive 50% more output than yearly ones (Sales data).
  * Every 90 days is "End of Year" crunch time.

## 4. Execution Algorithm

### Step 1: The Vision (25Y)

* **Constraint**: Must be exciting enough to override the pain of execution.
* **Scope**: Career, Body, Relationships, Mastery.
* **Review**: Read daily to prime the RAS.

### Step 2: The Sprint (90D)

* **Selection**: Choose 1-3 "Big Moves" that represent 1% progress.
* **Criteria**:
  * Is this *completed* or *not*? (Binary outcome).
  * Does this move the needle on the 25Y vision?
* **Anti-Pattern**: "Shiny Object Syndrome" (switching focus mid-sprint).
  * *Fix*: Put new ideas in the "Parking Lot" until Day 91.

### Step 3: The Pulse (Weekly/Daily)

* **Week**: Review 90D progress. Adjust tactics, not goals.
* **Day**: Execute the "Big 3" tasks that feed the 90D goal.

## 5. Strategic Implications for Athena

1. **Avoid Medium-Term Optimizations**: Do not optimize for 6-month outcomes if they contradict the 25-year trajectory.
2. **Sprint Discipline**: Once a 90-day arc is set in `task.md`, **do not change it** unless existential ruin is imminent.
3. **Priming**: Remind the User of the 25Y link when drudgery (Cutting Stone) sets in. "This is not data entry; this is building the Cathedral."
