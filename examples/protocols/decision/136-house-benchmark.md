# Protocol 136: The House Benchmark

> **The Metric**: Long-Term Expectancy (EV), not Win Rate (WR).
> **The Source**: Singapore Pools (The House).
> **The Ceiling**: ~25% Weighted House Edge.

## 1. The Core Logic (Priced Markets)

In a liquid, priced market (Stocks, Forex, Crypto), if the **House** (who rigs the game with infinite bankroll) only extracts a **~25% weighted edge**, then **no retail participant** can consistently extract more than that without:

1. **Insider Information** (Illegal/Asymmetric).
2. **Structural Inefficiency** (Illiquid markets).

**The Law of Scalability:**
If a strategy yields >50% consistently, **it cannot scale**.

* *Why?* Compounding mechanics. If it could scale, the owner would own the entire GDP of the planet within 10 years.
* *The Trap:* Scammers show high returns on *tiny* capital ($100 account), which breaks instantly at volume.

## 2. The Heuristic (The "Smell Test")

When evaluating Trading Systems, Yields, or "Business Opportunities":

| Claimed EV / Edge | Verdict | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **5% - 15%** | Realistic | Investigate. This is "Hard Work" (Alpha). |
| **15% - 30%** | Exceptional | **Receipts Required**. This is "World Class" (Renaissance Tech). |
| **30% - 60%** | The House Limit | **Extreme Caution**. Only possible in short bursts or illiquid markets. |
| **> 60%** | **SCAM / TAIL RISK** | **RUN**. It is either a Ponzi or a Martingale strategy waiting to blow up. |

## 3. The "Day Trader" Paradox

> "If they are offering such a huge edge (>60%), they don't even need to sell anything to you, just stay home and print $ can liao."

* **The Check**: If the edge was real, the **Opportunity Cost** of creating/selling the course would be infinitely higher than the revenue from the course.
* **Conclusion**: They are selling the shovel because there is no gold in the ground.
* **The Exception**: Renaissance Technologies (Medallion Fund). They have a ~66% annualized return. **They do not accept outside money.** This proves the rule.

## 4. The Critical Distinction: Win Rate vs. Expectancy

Do not be fooled by "90% Win Rate".

* **Scam Bot**: Wins $1 (90% of the time). Loses $100 (10% of the time).
* **Result**: Negative Expectancy (Ruin).
* **Question to Ask**: "What is the Max Drawdown and Risk-Adjusted Return over 1,000 trades?"

## 5. Application

Use this filter immediately on:

1. **Crypto Staking** (If yield > US Treasury + 5%, ask: "Who is paying for this yield?").
2. **Forex Bots** (High win rates usually hide catastrophic tail risk).
3. **Agency Promises** ("10x ROAS Guaranteed" = They will burn your brand).
