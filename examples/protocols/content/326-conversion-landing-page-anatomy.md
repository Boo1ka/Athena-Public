┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. HERO: Pain → Promise → Proof Tease         │
│  2. SOCIAL PROOF: Media logos, trust badges    │
│  3. SERVICES: Feature → Benefit framing        │
│  4. PERSONAL LETTER: Founder voice, intimacy   │
│  5. ANTI-QUALIFICATION: "We're selective"      │
│  6. TESTIMONIALS: Video + specific ROI numbers │
│  7. FAQ: Objection handling + Schema SEO       │
│  8. CTA: Risk reversal guarantee               │

## Stealable Patterns

### 1. Personal Letter Format

- "From the desk of [Name], on [Date]"
- First-person, empathetic tone
- Positions founder as trusted advisor, not vendor

### 2. ROI-Only Messaging

- Attack vanity metrics: "We don't care about likes, impressions, comments"
- Promise real outcomes: "LEADS, SALES, REVENUE"
- Resonates with SME owners burned by bad agencies

### 3. Anti-Qualification Framing

- "We don't take just any client"
- "We have a qualification process"
- **Effect**: Flips power dynamic, creates scarcity

### 4. Specific ROI Testimonials

- Bad: "They're great to work with!"
- Good: "Spent $11,200 → Closed $161,000 in 6 months"
- **Rule**: Numbers beat adjectives. Specificity = credibility.

### 5. Risk Reversal Guarantee

- "Fire our sorry asses after 14 days"
- "You don't pay us to try us out"
- **Effect**: Eliminates purchase friction

### 6. Trust Anchors

- "As seen on: [Media logos]"
- "Supported by: [Government grants]" (PSG for SG)
- "4.8★ based on 53 reviews" with embedded widget

### 7. FAQ Schema Markup

- Addresses objections directly on page
- Provides SEO juice via structured data
- Common Qs: Pricing, why you vs competitors, past results

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

| Pattern | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "Worth $X,XXX" inflated value claims | Undermines credibility |
| 8+ identical CTAs on one page | Desperation signal |
| Generic stock imagery | Cheap, forgettable |
| WordPress/Elementor bloat | Slow load = bounce |

---

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Personal founder voice in copy
- [ ] At least 2 video testimonials with ROI numbers
- [ ] Anti-qualification framing ("not for everyone")
- [ ] Clear guarantee / risk reversal
- [ ] FAQ section with Schema markup
- [ ] Trust badges (media, reviews, certifications)
