# Protocol 280: Meta Ads Architecture

> **Source**: Stolen from r/DigitalMarketing (Financial Advisor Case Study) + Internal Best Practices.
> **Context**: High Trust / Low Intent Niches (Services, Finance, Consulting).

---

## 1. The Core Physics

Meta Ads are **Interruption Marketing**. Users are doom-scrolling, not searching.

- **Goal**: Stop the scroll → Earn 3 seconds → Exchange value for data.
- **The Trade**: You are buying data, not customers.

## 2. Offer Hierarchy (Cost vs friction)

| Offer Type | Cost/Lead (Est) | Quality | Friction | Verdict |
|------------|-----------------|---------|----------|---------|
| **Instant Form** | $9 - $20 | Low | Very Low | **Volume King**. Use for list building. Expect 50% junk. |
| **Webinar (Recorded)**| $30 - $60 | Med | Med | **Sweet Spot**. Automated trust building. |
| **Webinar (Live)** | $50 - $100+ | High | High | Hard to fill. High show-up attrition. |
| **In-Person Event** | $$$$ | Very High | Extreme | **Avoid** unless ultra-high ticket backend. |
| **Website Conversion**| Mixed | High | Med/High | **Quality King**. Users who click-through are more serious. |

> **Strategy**: Start with Instant Forms for volume/pixel data, then retarget with Website Conversions.

## 3. Creative Strategy (The "Scroll Stopper")

The **Creative** is 80% of the targeting.

### A. Visuals

- **Contrast Rule**: The feed is Blue/White.
  - **WIN**: Orange, Yellow, Green, High Contrast Black.
  - **LOSE**: Corporate Blue, stock photos of people shaking hands.
- **Pattern Interrupt**: "Ugly" ads often outperform "Polished" ads.

### B. Video Paradox

- **Charismatic Founder**: Video wins. (Head talking, high energy).
- **Non-Charismatic**: Video fails. High CPM, low watch time.
- **Rule**: If you can't hold attention for 3s organically, use a **Static Image**. Don't force video.

## 4. Targeting: The Niche Exception

> **Modern Meta Wisdom**: "Go Broad. Let AI find the audience."
> **The Exception**: Highly Regulated / Niche Services (e.g., Financial Advisors).

- **Broad**: Meta AI often struggles with specific compliance-heavy niches initially.
- **Core (Specific)**: Manually selected interests/behaviors often outperform Broad in these specific verticals because conversion volume is too low for Broad to learn fast enough.
- **Verdict**: Test **Core** (Specific) vs **Broad**. Do not blindly trust "Broad is King" for low-volume B2B/High-Ticket.

## 5. Tracking Hurdles

**The GHL (GoHighLevel) Trap**:

- GHL often sends `Lead` events for page views.
- **Result**: Meta optimizes for "Page View" thinking it's a "Lead".
- **Fix**: Ensure Custom Conversions track the specific **Thank You Page URL** (e.g., `/thank-you`), not just the button click event.

## 6. Execution Checklist

- [ ] **Objective**: Leads (Instant Form) or Sales (Conversion). Never "Traffic".
- [ ] **Creative**: 3 Variations (1 Image, 1 Video, 1 Carousel).
- [ ] **Contrast**: Does it stand out against a white background?
- [ ] **Pixel**: Verified active.
- [ ] **Event Match Quality**: >6/10.
