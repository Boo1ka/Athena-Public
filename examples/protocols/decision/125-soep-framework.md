# Protocol 118: SOEP (Second-Order Effect Protocol)

> **Source**: Zero-Point Codex  
> **Domain**: Decision / Social Physics  
> **Priority**: ⭐⭐ High

---

## Core Formula

```
Second-Order Effect Weight Distribution:
├─ First-order (content/direct): 5-10%
├─ Second-order (behavior prediction): 50-60% ⭐
├─ Third-order (observer repositioning): 25-35%
└─ Fourth-order (reputation lock): 5-10%

Core Truth: Second-order effects have ABSOLUTE VETO over first-order ⚠️
```

---

## The Account System

Every action in a social context affects multiple "accounts" simultaneously:

### Account A: Content (5-10%)

```
What it tracks:
├─ Direct material gains/losses
├─ Literal information obtained
├─ Surface goal achievement
└─ Visible skill demonstration

Weight: 5-10% (important but secondary)
```

### Account B: Image (60-70%) ⭐

```
What it tracks:
├─ How L3 observers reposition you
├─ "What this predicts about you"
├─ How future interactions change
└─ Long-term reputation impact

Weight: 60-70% (DOMINANT)

Key Question:
"If I were a bystander watching this behavior,
 what impression would I form of this person?"
```

### Account C: Relationship Capital (15-20%)

```
What it tracks:
├─ Trust increase/decrease
├─ Intimacy level movement
├─ Social capital changes
└─ Future collaboration possibility

Formula: Social Capital Balance = Σ(Deposits) - Σ(Withdrawals)

Weight: 15-20%
```

### Account D: Optionality (5-10%)

```
What it tracks:
├─ Future choices increased/decreased
├─ Exit channels opened/closed
├─ Information value
└─ Strategic flexibility changes

Weight: 5-10%
```

## Classic Case: Hot Bun Tantrum (#HB-005)

```
【Situation】
├─ Location: NS Mess
├─ Observers: 20-30 peers
├─ Arena: Forced Intimacy (95% image weight)
└─ Event: Bun distribution → didn't get one → tantrum

【Account Analysis】

Tantrum Path:
Account A (Content): +1 (got the bun)
Account B (Image): -750
├─ "Childish/emotional" (-200)
├─ "Can't handle small setbacks" (-150)
├─ "Needs to be managed" (-200)
└─ "Permanent label" (-200)

Total: Content +1 | Image -850 | Relationship -100 | Net -949 ☠️
ROI Ratio: 1:950

【Counterfactual (Correct Response)】

Calm acceptance:
Account A: -1 (didn't get bun this time)
Account B: +100
├─ "Mature/composed" (+30)
├─ "Can handle setbacks" (+30)
├─ "Doesn't sweat small stuff" (+20)
└─ "Reliable teammate" (+20)

Total: Content -1 | Image +100 | Relationship +20 | Net +119 ✅
Difference: 1,068 points (106,800%)
```

## SOEP Application Protocol (Real-Time Use)

### Pre-Action Check (5 seconds)

```
Step 1: Identify Arena (2 sec)
└─ What's the image weight here?

Step 2: Account Forecast (2 sec)
├─ Account A (content): ___
├─ Account B (image): ___
└─ Net Value: ___

Step 3: Verdict (1 sec)
├─ Net > 0 → Execute ✅
├─ Net -50 to 0 → Careful evaluation ⚠️
└─ Net < -50 → Veto ❌
```

### Special Rules

**Forced Intimacy/Corporate Environment:**

```
├─ Account B weight: 90-95%
├─ Threshold: Account B < -100 → Auto-veto
└─ Reason: Permanent impact, unrecoverable
```

---

## Image Damage Grading

| Score Range | Severity | Consequence | Response |
|-------------|----------|-------------|----------|
| 0 to -500 | Neutral-Negative | Short-term embarrassment | Repair relationship |
| -2K to -10K | Serious | Career impact, social exclusion | Image rebuild plan |
| -25K to -50K | Catastrophic | Permanent label, lost opportunities | Strategic withdrawal |

**Veto Rule**: Account B < -20K AND P > 10% → Absolute veto ⛔

---

## L3 Observer Weight (Face Culture)

The "L3 Observer" is anyone watching who is NOT directly involved:

```
Three-Layer Image System:

L1 Internal (5-10%): What you know/feel/intend
└─ "What am I thinking"

L2 Participant (15-25%): Direct participant's experience
└─ "How does the other person see me"

L3 Observer (70-85%): ⭐ Third-party inference from observable
└─ "What would a stranger think"

⚠️ L3 has ABSOLUTE VETO POWER
```

**Singapore Amplification**: ×1.5-2.5 (vs. Western ×0.5-0.8)

---

## Social Capital Accounting

```
Deposits (Build Capital):
├─ Help others (unrequested)
├─ Make others look good
├─ Generosity (time/resources)
└─ Warmth (genuine care)

Withdrawals (Spend Capital):
├─ Public correction of others
├─ Displaying superiority
├─ Showing off wealth/achievement
└─ Saying "Actually..." (dismissing views)

Avalanche Mechanism:
Resentment Accumulation (Silent)
    → Permission Event (Discovered violation)
    → Activation = Avalanche ☠️
```

---

## Decision Tree

```
Action contemplated
    ↓
Identify Arena Type
├─ Forced Intimacy (NS/Office)? → 95% image weight ⚠️
├─ Digital/Social? → Screenshot eternal ⚠️
├─ Casual/Private? → Normal weighting
└─ Freedom Zone? → Presence > Strategy

Run Account Forecast:
├─ Account A: ___
├─ Account B: ___
├─ Account C: ___
├─ Account D: ___
└─ Net: ___

If Net < -50 AND (Forced/Corporate):
└─ VETO ⛔

If Net > 0:
└─ Execute ✅
```
