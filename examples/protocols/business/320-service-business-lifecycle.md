## Step 1: Pull Demand (Niche Selection)

**Principle**: Ride existing demand. Don't create it.

| Do ✅ | Don't ❌ |
|-------|---------|
| Find markets where people are *already* searching | Invent new categories |
| Validate with Carousell listings, Google Trends | Build and hope |
| Niche down to reduce competition | Go broad and fight giants |

**Validation Heuristic**:

- Can you find 10+ competitors doing this profitably?
- Is there search volume for the service?
- Are people paying, not just interested?

**Pull > Push**. If you have to convince people they need it, you're pushing.

---

## Step 2: Distribution Slutting (Content Volume)

**Principle**: Attention is the top of funnel. Volume beats perfection.

| Channel | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Carousell** | Transactional intent, direct sales |
| **SEO/Blog** | Long-term organic, authority building |
| **Social** | Awareness, brand personality |
| **Referrals** | Highest conversion, lowest CAC |

**Execution Rules**:

1. **70% Rule**: Ship content at 70% polish. Speed > Perfection.
2. **Repurpose**: One insight → Blog post → Carousell copy → Social snippet
3. **Consistency**: Daily/weekly cadence > sporadic bursts

**Goal**: Be *everywhere* your target customer looks.

---

## Step 3: Offer Stack (Tiered Pricing)

**Principle**: Price is a filter. Different tiers serve different customers.

| Tier | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Free** | Lead generation, trust building | Free consultation, template |
| **Entry** | Low-risk first purchase | $50-100 one-off service |
| **Core** | Main revenue driver | $150-500/session or project |
| **Premium** | High-touch, high-margin | $1,000+ retainer or package |

**Pricing Psychology**:

- Cheap price = cheap clients (scope creep, complaints)
- Premium price = premium clients (respect, clarity, fewer headaches)
- **Use price as qualification**, not just revenue

**The XYZ Model**:

- **X** = Base fee (covers your time)
- **Y** = Output bonus (deliverables completed)
- **Z** = Outcome bonus (results achieved)

---

## Step 4: Moat Construction (Defensibility)

**Principle**: Build what competitors can't copy.

| Moat Type | How to Build |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Brand** | Consistent voice, visual identity, reputation |
| **Process** | AI-assisted workflows, speed advantage |
| **Trust** | Portfolio, testimonials, case studies |
| **Network** | Referral flywheel, community |
| **Data** | Proprietary insights from client work |

**Test**: If a competitor with $10K appeared tomorrow, what would stop them from taking your clients?

Without a moat, Step 6 (exit) has nothing to sell.

---

## Step 5: Scale (Systematize Before Growing)

**Principle**: Document before delegating. Systems before staff.

| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **1. Document** | Write SOPs for every repeatable task |
| **2. Automate** | Replace manual steps with scripts/tools |
| **3. Delegate** | Hire/outsource only documented tasks |
| **4. Monitor** | Track quality, iterate on SOPs |

**Scaling Chaos Warning**:
> If you scale without systems, you scale chaos.  
> 10 clients without SOPs = 10x the headaches, not 10x the profit.

**Capacity Rule**: Only take on what you can deliver well. Reputation > Revenue.

---

## Step 6: Exit (Design from Day 1)

**Principle**: Build assets, not just income.

| Asset | Exit Value |
|-------|------------|
| **Brand** | Transferable if name-agnostic |
| **SOPs** | Buyer can run without you |
| **Client List** | Recurring relationships = recurring revenue |
| **Content** | SEO assets, templates, IP |

**Founder-Led Business Warning**:
> If the brand IS you, you cannot exit.

**Decoupling Strategy**:

1. Create a separate brand name (not "Winston's Web Design")
2. Build systems that don't require *your* judgment
3. Transition client relationships to the brand, not you
4. Document your "secret sauce" so others can replicate

**Exit Options**:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Clean Exit** | Wind down gracefully, refer clients elsewhere |
| **Acqui-hire** | Sell your skills/team to a larger org |
| **Asset Sale** | Sell brand, client list, SOPs |
| **Full Sale** | Sell operating business with ongoing revenue |

---

## Quick Reference

| Step | Key Question |
|------|--------------|
| 1. Pull Demand | Are people *already* buying this? |
| 2. Distribution | Am I everywhere my customer looks? |
| 3. Offer Stack | Am I filtering for the right clients? |
| 4. Moat Build | What stops competitors from copying me? |
| 5. Scale | Are my systems documented before I grow? |
| 6. Exit | Am I building assets or just income? |
