# Protocol 92: Formal/Informal Reality Gap (The "De Facto" Override)

> **Core Insight**: The frustration comes from believing the Formal Rules (De Jure) are the operating system. They are not. They are the PR layer. The Informal Rules (De Facto) are the real operating system.
> **Origin**: Ex-Friend / Batam Case (Dec 2025)
> **Tags**: #reality-gap #de-jure-de-facto #social-calibration #gaslighting-defense

## 1. The Core Split

Every system has two layers. The "Crazy-Making" frustration happens when you try to enforce Layer 1 logic in a Layer 2 reality.

| Layer | Name | Definition | Function | Weight |
|-------|------|------------|----------|--------|
| **1** | **De Jure** (Formal) | What is *said*, written, or officially agreed. | Optics, PR, Plausible Deniability, "Face" | 10% |
| **2** | **De Facto** (Informal) | What is *done*, enacted, or actually prioritized. | **The Real Operating System** | 90% |

### The Meta-Gaslighting Trap

1. You perceive a gap between Layer 1 and Layer 2.
2. You point it out: *"You said X (Formal), but you did Y (Informal)."*
3. The System defends Layer 1: *"No, I meant X! You're being difficult!"*
4. **Result**: You are punished for noticing the reality.

## 2. Instantiations of the Gap

| Scenario | De Jure (The Lie) | De Facto (The Truth) | The Trap |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|----------|
| **The Flaky Friend** | "I'll go to Batam with you." | "I chose Rinjani with others." | Believing the *promise* instead of the *priority*. |
| **The "White Horse"** | "Officer outranks Recruit." | "Recruit's dad can crush Officer." | Relying on *rank* instead of *power*. |
| **The "Honest" Feedback** | "We want the truth." | "We want validation." | Speaking truth to power → Execution. |
| **The "Busy" Excuse** | "I'm too busy for 2 days." | "I have 4 days for them." | Debating the *excuse* instead of the *choice*. |

## 3. The Navigation Protocol

**Rule #1: The De Facto Override**
When Layer 1 (Words) conflicts with Layer 2 (Actions), Layer 2 **always** overrides. The Layer 1 data is corrupt. Discard it.

**Rule #2: Stop Litigating the Gap**
You cannot win an argument about the Gap.

* **Why**: To win, the other person must admit they are lying/fake. They will burn the bridge before admitting that.
* **Move**: Do not confront. *Adjust your position based on the De Facto reality.*

**Rule #3: The Soft Rejection Heuristic** (2 Soft = 1 Hard)

* **De Jure**: "Busy right now."
* **De Facto**: "You are low priority."
* **Action**: Downgrade them to "Acquaintance". No explanation needed.

## 4. The "Am I Crazy?" Check

When you feel the rage of "Knowing what is right vs. wrog":

1. **Check**: Am I angry because they broke a Formal Rule?
2. **Reality Check**: Does the Informal Rule allow them to do this? (e.g., "People flake on low-value options")
3. **Verdict**: Your perception of the *action* is right. Your expectation of *justice* is wrong.
4. **Fix**: Update your internal map. "Oh, the rule here is *Flaking is allowed*." -> **Stop playing.**

> **"The only way to win the Unwinnable Game is to refuse to play it."**

## 5. Application: Ex-Friend Closure

* **Formal**: He agreed → He broke promise → He is wrong.
* **Informal**: He had better option → He look it → He gaslit to save face.
* **Your Move**:
  * Social Value: 0
  * Economic Value: 0

  ## 6. The Corporate Corollary (Employment as Transaction)

* **De Jure (The Myth)**: "We are a family," "Loyalty is rewarded," "Performance protects you."
* **De Facto (The Mechanics)**: Employment is a spot market transaction. Money for labor.
* **The Error**: Believing the "Family" script leads to "Noble Suffering" (staying too long, expecting protection).
* **The Fix**: View the company as a vending machine. Insert labor, extract money/skills. When the machine stops dispensing, leave. Do not hug the machine.

## 7. Political Capital (The Insurance Principle)

In De Facto structural conflicts (e.g., facing a PIP), being "Right" is irrelevant. Being "Protected" is everything.

* **Political Capital = Insurance**.
* **The Trap**: Trying to buy insurance *after* the fire starts (once the PIP is drafted).
* **The Rule**: You must build alliances *before* you need them. If you have no alliances when the conflict starts, **you have already lost**. Exit immediately.
