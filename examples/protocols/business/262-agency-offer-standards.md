# Protocol 262: Agency Offer Standards

> **Purpose**: Standardized pricing and risk-reversal structure for Agency Services (Facebook Ads).
> **Context**: Updated Session 2026-01-05-03 (Added "The Taster" Strategy).

---

## 1. Pricing Structure (The Floor)

| Component | Minimum | Rationale |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Setup Fee** | **$500+** | Non-recoverable labor (setup, research, creative). |
| **Ad Spend** | **$500+** | Minimum for statistical significance & algorithm learning. |
| **Mgmt Fee** | **15-25%** | Ongoing optimization (Month 2+). |

**Rule**: Never subsidize the ad spend. Client pays platform directly.

## 2. Risk-Reversal Guarantee (The "30 in 90")

**Offer**: "30 Qualified Leads in 90 Days or Full Refund of Service Fees."

### 2.1 The "Qualified Lead" Definition (Safety Valve)

To prevent "quality" disputes, defining "Lead" mechanically is mandatory:

- **Format**: Completed form/message via ad.
- **Data**: Valid Name + Contact Info.
- **Geo**: Within targeted radius.
- **Clarification**: Guarantee is for *Lead Delivery*, not *Sales Conversion*.

### 2.2 Client Obligations (Anti-Sabotage)

Guarantee is **VOID** if:

1. **Spend**: Client cuts budget below $500/mo.
2. **Speed**: Client fails to contact leads within 24 hours.
3. **Access**: Client revokes/delays access to accounts >3 days.

## 3. The SDR Check (Law #2)

- **Target**: 30 leads / 90 days = 10 leads/month.
- **Math**: At $500 spend, requires **$50 CPA**.
- **Niche Selection**:
  - ✅ **Viable**: Local Services (Dentist, Plumber, Gym).
  - ❌ **Danger**: Luxury Real Estate, B2B SaaS, High-Ticket Consulting.

## 4. Contract Clauses (Standard)
>
> "Agency guarantees the delivery of 30 Qualified Leads within the first 90 days. If not met, Client is entitled to a full refund of Service Management Fees. Ad spend is non-refundable. Failure to maintain $500/mo spend or contact leads within 24h voids this guarantee."

---

## 5. "The Taster" Strategy (Information Buying)

> **Purpose**: Use free work to buy information, trust, and apprenticeship-level access.
> **Warning**: Must be strictly scoped to prevent "unlimited free work" trap.

### 5.1 The Offer

"I will build you a **Custom Demo Landing Page** and a **3-Month Growth Plan** (PDF) for free. You use them whether you hire me or not."

### 5.2 The Scope Cap (Mandatory)

To ensure this remains high-leverage:

1. **Time Cap**: 120 Minutes Maximum per Client.
    - 60 mins: Template-based Landing Page (Concept only, Lorem Ipsum text).
    - 60 mins: Research & Proposal Deck.
2. **Deliverable Format**:
    - **Website**: `.png` Image or Read-Only Figma Link (Do NOT code it yet).
    - **Proposal**: 3-Slide PDF (Status Quo -> The Gap -> The Solution).
3. **No Revisions**: "This is a concept demo. Revisions start with a paid engagement."

### 5.3 The Apprenticeship ROI

Even if they say no, you gain:

1. **Portfolio Asset**: Keep the concept for your case study.
2. **Market Data**: You learned their specific objection.
3. **Fluency**: You learned their industry jargon.
