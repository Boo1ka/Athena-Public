# Protocol 282: The Viral Wrapper

> **Purpose**: Convert authentic, raw thoughts into high-velocity LinkedIn content without compromising the "soul" of the message.
> **Philosophy**: "Authenticity is the Product. Virality is the Packaging."
> **Source**: Allen Wang (Viral Hooks) + [Signal Density](file:///Users/[AUTHOR]/Desktop/Project Athena/.agent/skills/protocols/content/Content_Publication_Standard.md)
> **Tags**: #viral #linkedin #writing #framework

## 1. The Core Mechanic: The "Authenticity Sandwich"

Most people fail because they try to *write* for the algorithm.
**The Fix**: Write for *yourself*, then *wrap* for the algorithm.

1. **The Meat (Authentic Core)**: Write what you actually want to say. No formatting. No filters. Just the raw insight/rant.
2. **The Bread (Viral Wrapper)**: Apply the Hook (Top) and the Call-to-Value (Bottom).
3. **The Plating (Formatting)**: Apply the visual scannability rules.

## 2. The Wrapper Components

### A. The "Allen Wang" Hook (The First 2 Lines)

**Rule**: The decision to read is made in the first 2 lines (before "See more").
**Constraint**: Must spark *immediate* curiosity or signal *high value*.

| Hook Type | Formula | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Contrast** | `[High Status Anchor] + [Low Status Action]` | "I dropped out of Berkeley to replicate Tinder with AI." |
| **The Reveal** | `[Result] + [Mechanism hint]` | "I generated 100k views with 0 ad spend. Here is the script." |
| **The Counter-Narrative** | `[Common Belief] is a lie. Here is [Truth].` | "Scaling via ads is a trap. Here is why organic wins." |
| **The Vulnerability** | `[Professional Facade] vs [Private Struggle]` | "On LinkedIn, I am a CEO. At home, I am $50k in debt." |

### B. The Visual Rule (The Scroll Stopper)

**Rule**: Text-only posts die. You MUST arrest the scroll.
**Priority**:

1. **Group Photo / Human Face**: High trust, "Not AI".
2. **Visual Asset**: Diagram, Chart, or "Cheat Sheet".
3. **Carousel**: Multi-slide value (High dwell time).

### C. The Body Structure (The Slide)

Once they click "See more", they must slide down the page effortlessly.

- **One Idea Per Post**: Don't stuff.
- **Micro-Paragraphs**: 1-2 sentences max per block.
- **The "Turn"**: A specific moment where the insight clicks.

## 3. The Workflow (SOP)

### Step 1: The Raw Dump (User Input)
>
> "I want to write about how students are getting scammed by AI degrees."

### Step 2: Extract the "Gem"
>
> **Insight**: 4-month bootcamps cannot replicate 4 years of statistics. It's a "Skills Illusion."

### Step 3: Engineer 3 Hooks
>
> 1. "Stop paying for AI Bootcamps." (Direct)
> 2. "We are selling a lie to 10,000 students." (Moral/Fear)
> 3. "No prior experience needed? That sentence should scare you." (Curiosity) -> **WINNER**

### Step 4: Apply Visuals
>
> [Directive]: Attach the screenshot of the "No experience needed" ad.

### Step 5: Final Polish
>
> Check against [Content_Publication_Standard.md](file:///Users/[AUTHOR]/Desktop/Project Athena/.agent/skills/protocols/content/Content_Publication_Standard.md) for "AI Slop" words.

## 4. The "Sellout" Guardrail

**Risk**: You become a "LinkedIn Bro."
**The Check**: Read the post out loud. If you cringe, **dial it back**.
**Rule**: The Hook attracts attention, but the **Insight** must retain respect. Never use a Hook that the Insight cannot pay off.
