# Protocol 118: SOEP Framework (Social-Economic Outcome Prioritization)

> **Source**: Zero-Point Codex Synthesis  
> **Domain**: Decision / Social Physics  
> **Priority**: ⭐⭐⭐ Critical

---

## Core Principle

> **Every action deposits or withdraws from multiple accounts simultaneously. Optimize for net portfolio value across ALL accounts—not just the obvious one.**

---

## The Multi-Account Model

| Account | Weight | Description | Time Horizon |
|---------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Account A** | 10-20% | Immediate objective outcome | Minutes-hours |
| **Account B** | 40-60% | Third-party perception/reputation | Months-years |
| **Account C** | 20-30% | Relationship quality with direct participants | Weeks-years |
| **Account D** | 10-20% | Internal state (energy, self-respect) | Ongoing |

---

## The Fundamental Error

```
Naive Optimization:
├─ Focus only on Account A (getting what you want)
├─ Ignore Account B (how you look getting it)
├─ Ignore Account C (relationship damage)
├─ Ignore Account D (self-cost)
└─ NET: Pyrrhic victory (-800 net even with +50 on A)

Sophisticated Optimization:
├─ Calculate ALL account impacts
├─ Weight by arena context (e.g., SG = high Account B)
├─ Veto if net is negative
└─ Accept "-1" on A if "+100" on B
```

## Account Weighting by Arena

| Arena | Account A | Account B | Account C | Account D |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **NS/Military** | 5% | 70% | 20% | 5% |
| **Corporate/Office** | 15% | 55% | 25% | 5% |
| **Extended Family** | 10% | 50% | 35% | 5% |
| **Close Friends** | 25% | 25% | 40% | 10% |
| **Intimate Partner** | 20% | 10% | 50% | 20% |
| **Private/Solo** | 40% | 0% | 0% | 60% |

## Classic SOEP Problems

### Problem 1: Hot Bun Tantrum (NS Context)

```
Situation: Someone takes the last hot bun at cookhouse
Naive Response: Demand it back loudly

Account A: +1 (got the bun, maybe)
Account B: -850 (permanent "childish" label in 95% arena)
Account C: -200 (relationship with bunkmates)
Account D: -50 (adrenaline crash, self-disgust later)

NET: -1,099 ☠️

Correct Response: Let it go, get cold bun

Account A: -1 (no hot bun)
Account B: +100 (composed, mature)
Account C: +50 (easy to work with)
Account D: +20 (self-control reinforced)

NET: +169 ✅
```

### Problem 2: Office Credit Claim

```
Situation: You did 80% of project work
Naive Response: Claim credit publicly in meeting

Account A: +100 (recognition, maybe promotion)
Account B: -300 (seen as not a team player)
Account C: -400 (colleagues resentful)
Account D: +50 (ego satisfied)

NET: -550 ☠️

Correct Response: Credit the team, let work speak

Account A: 0 (no immediate recognition)
Account B: +200 (team player image)
Account C: +150 (goodwill with colleagues)
Account D: -20 (slight frustration)

NET: +330 ✅
```

### Problem 3: Winning Argument with Partner

```
Situation: You're factually correct in disagreement
Naive Response: Prove you're right, win argument

Account A: +100 (validation of correctness)
Account B: N/A (private)
Account C: -500 (emotional distance, resentment)
Account D: +30 (ego) / -100 (emptiness of lonely victory)

NET: -470 ☠️

Correct Response: Acknowledge feelings first, facts later (if needed)

Account A: -50 (may not get to "win")
Account B: N/A
Account C: +200 (emotional connection)
Account D: +100 (mature, aligned with values)

NET: +250 ✅
```

### Problem 4: The Grab Career Trap (Terminal Logic)

```
Situation: Retrenchment. Need cash flow.
Naive Response: "Just drive Grab for $5k/mth"

Account A (Cash): +$5,000 (Immediate Relief)
Account B (Status): -200 (Downgrade perception)
Account C (Network): -1,000 (Disconnect from industry peers)
Account D (Asset): -5,000 (Skill Atrophy + No CPF + No Career Ladder)

NET: -1,200 ☠️ (Bankruptcy masquerading as Solvency)

Correct Response: Part-time survival job + Asset Construction (Upskill/Build)

Account A (Cash): +$2,500 (Survival only)
Account B (Status): 0 (Neutral)
Account C (Network): +100 (Staying relevant)
Account D (Asset): +5,000 (New capabilities for next cycle)

NET: +7,600 ✅ (Short-term pain, Long-term gain)
```

## SOEP Decision Checklist

```markdown
Before any significant social action:

☐ What do I gain on Account A? (Immediate objective)
☐ What do I lose/gain on Account B? (Third-party perception)
☐ What do I lose/gain on Account C? (Relationship with participants)
☐ What do I lose/gain on Account D? (Internal state, energy)

☐ What's the arena weighting? (NS? Office? Family? Private?)
☐ Calculate weighted net across all accounts

IF Net < 0:
└─ VETO ACTION ⛔

IF Account B < -500 in high-weight arena:
└─ VETO ACTION ⛔ (catastrophic face damage)
```

## Singapore Calibration

In Singapore (and broader East Asian) contexts, apply Face Culture multiplier:

- **Account B weight × 1.5-2.5** (L3 observer culture)
- **Account B losses × 2.0** (face damage amplified)
- **Account B recovery time × 2.0** (takes longer to rebuild)

See: [SG-002: Face Culture Physics](file:///Users/[AUTHOR]/Desktop/Project Athena/.agent/skills/protocols/singapore/SG-002-face-physics.md)

## Integration Points

- **[SG-002](file:///Users/[AUTHOR]/Desktop/Project Athena/.agent/skills/protocols/singapore/SG-002-face-physics.md)**: Face culture amplifies Account B
- **[SG-003](file:///Users/[AUTHOR]/Desktop/Project Athena/.agent/skills/protocols/singapore/SG-003-ns-arena.md)**: NS arena = 95% Account B weight
- **[Protocol 117](file:///Users/[AUTHOR]/Desktop/Project Athena/.agent/skills/protocols/pattern-detection/117-randian-dilemma.md)**: SOEP helps navigate Randian trade-offs
