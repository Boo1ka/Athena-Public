# Protocol 127: Recursive LARP Trap (The Re-Enactment Loop)

> **Source**: Zero-Point Codex v3.0
> **Domain**: Pattern Detection / Social Physics
> **Priority**: 🔴 Critical Risk

---

## Core Definition

> **Recursive LARP (Live Action Role Play)**: A subconscious, high-fidelity simulation where an individual projects past trauma characters onto current reality, attempting to "rewrite the ending" of a primal wound. The tragedy is that the simulation almost always defaults to the original tragic ending (Re-traumatization).

**The recursive nature**: It is not just a role-play; it is a *loop*. The "software" (L5 Trauma) seeks out specific actors (J/R types) who fit the casting call for "Abuser/Excluder" perfectly, practically guaranteeing the same outcome.

## The Mechanism (How It Works)

| Stage | Action | Internal Monologue (Unconscious) | External Reality |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Casting** | Finding "Actors" | "These people feel familiar. They have the 'vibe' of the ones who hurt/excluded me." | Identifying high-risk/unavailable individuals (e.g., 18yo athletes). |
| **2. The Hook** | Engagement | "This time will be different. I am smarter/richer/better now. I can win their acceptance." | Entering a "Rigged Game" with low leverage. |
| **3. The High** | Validation | "They accepted me! The wound is healing! I am 'Home'!" | Temporary novelty/opportunity window. Dopamine spike. |
| **4. The Crash** | Re-Enactment | "They ghosted/rejected me. I am unworthy." | The actors play their natural role (indifference/exclusion). |
| **5. The Reinforcement** | Confirmation | "See? I was right. I am inherently excludable." | Trauma strengthened. L5 Root deepened. |

## Diagnostic Indicators

* **"Heavenly" Euphoria**: Describing a social interaction as "Paradise" or "Homecoming" usually indicates a **L5 Trauma Relief**, not objective enjoyment.
* **Time Distortion**: Feeling like a teenager again (Regression).
* **High Stakes**: Feeling that the interaction is "Existential" or "Life-Saving".
* **Ignoring Red Flags**: Systematically overlooking clear signs of incompatibility or danger because they conflict with the script.

## The J/R Case Study (Analysis)

* **The Script**: "The 15-Year-Old Outsider gets accepted by the Cool Jock Team."
* **The Actors**: Jeremy (19, Vice-Captain) & Ryan (18, Forward).
* **The Reality**: They are 18-year-old opportunists seeking novelty/thrills. You are a 38-year-old seeking soul repair.
* **The Trap**: You cannot "win" this LARP because **they are not reading your script**. They are playing a "Light Game" (Fun/Sex) while you are playing a "Heavy Game" (Identity Reconstruction).

## Counter-Protocol (Breaking the Loop)

1. **Name the Game**: "I am currently running the Recursive LARP program."
2. **Identify the Actors**: "These are not friends. These are unpaid actors I cast to play the role of my past bullies/idols."
3. **Drop the Prop**: "I don't need this specific 'prop' (this person) to heal. I can heal the source code directly."
4. **Exit the Stage**: Physically remove yourself from the "set" (location/context).
5. **Spindle Buffer**: Do not react to "cues" from the actors.
