# Protocol 010: Agentic Success Trinity

> **Origin**: User Intervention (2025-12-31)
> **Slogan**: "If your documentation is f***ed up, nothing else really matters."
> **Status**: **AXIOMATIC** (Non-negotiable).

---

## 1. The Core Axiom

Agentic Intelligence is not magic; it is **determinism wrapped in probability**.
Without clear instructions (Documentation) and paths (Workflows), the probabilities collapse into noise.

**The Trinity of Agentic Success**:

1. **Documentation** (The Map)
2. **Workflows** (The Path)
3. **Best Practices** (The Vehicle)

## 2. Pillar I: Documentation (The "Why-How-What" Framework)

You must document **before**, **during**, and **after**.
Every artifact must follow this strict hierarchy:

### 2.1 The Framework

1. **WHY** (Purpose):
    * Why does this exist?
    * What problem does it solve?
    * What is the context?
2. **HOW** (Mechanism):
    * How does it work?
    * What is the logic flow?
    * What are the dependencies?
3. **WHAT** (Execution):
    * What are the inputs and outputs?
    * What file is created?
    * What is the specific command?

> **Rule**: Never skip the "Why". A workflow without a "Why" is legacy code in the making.

---

## 3. Pillar II: Workflows (The Session Lifecycle)

Agentic interactions are not random; they are structured sequences.
You must define the full lifecycle of every operation.

### 3.1 The Lifecycle Definition

* **Start** (Initialization):
  * What triggers this?
  * What state must be loaded?
  * What context is required?
* **Throughout** (Execution Loop):
  * What is the feedback loop?
  * How do we handle errors?
  * Where are the checkpoints (QuickSaves)?
* **End** (Termination):
  * What is the "Definition of Done"?
  * How is it logged?
  * What artifacts are finalized?

## 4. Pillar III: Best Practices (Theft & Integration)

This is a developing field. Everyone is "figuring it out."
**Do not invent from scratch.**

### 4.1 The Strategy

1. **Scout**: Look at SOTA (State of the Art).
2. **Steal**: Copy the workflow (e.g., from Cursor, Claude, Vibe Coding).
3. **Integrate**: Adapt it to the Workspace immediately.

> **Directive**: If superior logic exists externally, internalize it.

---

## 5. Application

**Before starting ANY new project:**

1. Define the **Documentation** (Why/How/What).
2. Map the **Workflow** (Start/Loop/End).
3. Audit for **Best Practices** (Is there a better way?).
