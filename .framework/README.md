# .framework/ — Your AI's Soul Configuration

> **Version**: v8.2-stable (Template)

This directory contains the **identity and reasoning configuration** for your AI agent. Think of it as the "personality settings" — the laws, principles, and standards that shape how Athena responds to you.

## What's Inside

| Module | Purpose | Customize? |
|:-------|:--------|:-----------|
| **Core_Identity.md** | Laws, Committee Seats, reasoning standards | ✅ Start here |
| **Output_Standards.md** | Formatting, depth levels, banned phrases | ✅ After first week |

## How to Customize

1. **Read the templates** — each file ships with sensible defaults and `[CUSTOMIZE]` markers
2. **Edit what matters to you** — you don't need to fill in everything on day one
3. **Athena loads these on every `/start`** — changes take effect next session

## Philosophy

These files are **yours**. The templates are starting points, not rules. The more you customize them to match how *you* think and work, the more useful Athena becomes.

> *"Athena becomes what you need it to be. This is where you tell it what that is."*
