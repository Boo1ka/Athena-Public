# Protocol 309: Validation vs. Authority Architecture

> **Origin**: Session 2026-01-07-session-10  
> **Type**: Strategic Heuristic  
> **Status**: Active

## 1. Core Heuristic: The 90/10 Rule

Do not default to a single landing page for legitimate businesses.

- **10-20% of cases**: Use **Single Landing Page**.
- **80-90% of cases**: Use **Multi-Page Website** (with nested LP).

## 2. Mode A: Quick Validation (The 10%)

> **Use Case**: Testing a hypothesis. You do not know if the business works yet.

- **Architecture**: Single URL (Landing Page).
- **Traffic Source**: Paid Direct Response (Google Ads).
- **Conversion Goal**: Email/Phone Number.
- **Success Metric**: CPL (Cost Per Lead) / Validation of demand.
- **Vibe**: "Offer-centric."

**Formula**:
> Google Ads $\rightarrow$ Landing Page $\rightarrow$ Lead Capture $\rightarrow$ Validate Idea.

## 3. Mode B: Authority Construction (The 90%)

> **Use Case**: Real business, established service, long-term brand.

- **Architecture**: Multi-page Website (`/home`, `/about`, `/services`, `/contact`).
- **Integration**: The "Landing Page" is **nested** inside the site (e.g., `/offer/special-deal` or just the Home structure), but the site supports exploration.
- **Goal**: Trust, SEO, Authority, Brand Equity.
- **Vibe**: "Entity-centric."

## 4. The Trap

Building a single landing page for a business that needs authority signals (consulting, agency, B2B services) often signals "fly-by-night" or "dropshipper" energy.
**Real businesses have About pages.**
