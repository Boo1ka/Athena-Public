# 60. Business Strategic Frameworks

> **Origin**: Extracted from Session 15 Business Analysis (Balfour, Mentai-Ya, Agency Qualification).
> **Purpose**: Standardized models for analyzing business viability, career strategy, and failure causes.

## 1. Balfour’s Four Fits (Individual Adaption)

**Concept**: A system is only as strong as its weakest fit. All 4 must work in unison.

| Fit | Business Definition | Individual/Career Definition |
|-----|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Market-Product** | Does the market want this product? | Does the market need my specific skill set/output? |
| **Product-Channel** | Can this product reach the market? | Do my networking/visibility channels effectively showcase my skills? |
| **Channel-Model** | Does the channel support the business model (ARPU/CAC)? | Does the effort of networking/applying yield the income/lifestyle I want? |
| **Market-Model** | Will this market pay the price required? | Will this industry/employer pay the salary/rates I require? |

**Protocol**:

- When analyzing a career or business move, **Evaluate ALL 4 Fits**.
- Identifies the "Broken Link" (e.g., Great skills, great market, but using low-yield channels = Poor Product-Channel Fit).

## 2. MCDA (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis) for Failure Analysis

**Concept**: Rank reasons for failure (or options) by weighted impact rather than listing them flatly.

**Process**:

1. **Identify Alternatives** (e.g., Reasons for failure: Product, Pricing, Ops).
2. **Define Criteria** (e.g., Revenue Impact, Brand Damage, Scalability).
3. **Assign Weights** (e.g., Revenue = 35%, Brand = 25%).
4. **Score & Rank**: Calculate weighted scores to find the *root* catastrophic failure.

**Use Case**: Post-mortems (Mentai-Ya analysis) or complex decision making.

## 3. Agency Client Qualification (5-Step Filter)

**Concept**: Rapidly identify "Red Flag" clients without a long questionnaire. "Yellow Flags" require probing; "Red Flags" = immediate disqualify.

**The 5 Questions**:

1. **Product & Problem**: "Describe core product and primary problem solved." (Clarity check)
2. **Audience & Challenge**: "Who is ideal customer and biggest reach challenge?" (Market check)
3. **Engagement Value**: "Typical sale value/LTV?" (Financial viability check)
4. **Goal (6-12m)**: "#1 Business Goal?" (Realism check – e.g., "Market dominance with $100" = RED FLAG)
5. **Budget**: "Initial monthly budget range?" (Resource check)

## 4. Writing Service Pricing Heuristic

**Concept**: Low cost (<$10/100w) implies unsustainability or AI involvement.

- **Labour Arbitrage**: Outsourcing to low-cost regions.
- **Tech Arbitrage**: Unedited AI generation.
- **Risk**: Quality fade, plagiarism, lack of strategic nuance.

## 5. Risk Triaging Protocol (Executive Filter)

**Origin**: Anthropic Legal Team "Inbound Filter" (Dec 2025)

**Concept**: Do not process raw data yourself. Use AI to pre-process inbound requests (leads, tickets, messages) and output a "Risk/Opportunity Memo".

**Mechanism**:

1. **Input**: Raw text (Client email, Lead form, Document).
2. **AI Action**: Scan against "Policy Rules" (e.g., Budget < $500, Scope Creep words).
3. **Output**: Triaged Ticket (High/Medium/Low Risk) + Recommended Action.

**Integration**: Use these models when tagged `#business` or `#strategy` in user queries.
