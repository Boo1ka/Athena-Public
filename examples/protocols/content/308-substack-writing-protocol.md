# Protocol 308: Substack Writing Protocol (The Outcome Economy Engine)

> **Purpose**: Eliminates the "Blank Page Problem" by providing a rigid spec for converting raw observations into high-velocity, polarized content.
> **Identity**: The Sovereign Architect (Amoral Strategic Realism).

## 1. The Voice: Strategic Realism

* **Tone**: 70% Insight / 30% Provocation.
* **Stance**: "I am not here to moralize. I am here to explain the physics."
* **Adversary**: The "Credentialist" / The "Middleman" / The "Naive Idealist."
* **bANNED**: Moralizing words ("should", "ought"), corporate fluff ("synergy", "paradigm"), hedging ("maybe", "perhaps").

## 2. The Hook Formula: The "Violent Opening"

Don't bury the lead. Start with the "Violence" (the shattering of a belief).

* **Pattern A (The Hard Number)**: "Yesterday I did [X] for $[0] in [Y] seconds."
* **Pattern B (The Declaration of Death)**: "[X] is dead. Welcome to the era of [Y]."
* **Pattern C (The Inverse Truth)**: "You think [X] is an asset. It is actually a liability."

## 3. The Structure: The Outcome Stack

Every post must follow this 4-step logic flow. If a step is missing, the post fails.

| Step | Component | Concept | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **The Lie (Status Quo)** | What the "Old World" believes. | "You need a degree to be valuable." |
| **2** | **The Breaker (Empirical Truth)** | The data point that shatters the Lie. | "I replaced a $10k writer with one prompt." |
| **3** | **The New Physics** | The rule change that explains the Breaker. | "The Skill Premium has collapsed to Zero." |
| **4** | **The Artifact** | **Proof of Work**. What did you build? | "Here is the app/system/protocol." |

## 4. The "One Prompt" Workflow

**Objective**: reduce Time-to-Draft (TTD) to < 3 minutes.

**Input (User)**:
> "Bro, I just realized [Observation]. It's crazy because [Reason]."

**Process (AI)**:

1. **Identify the Lie**: What belief does this observation contradict?
2. **Tag the Physics**: Map it to `Outcome Economy`, `Sticker Moat`, `Sovereign Builder`.
3. **Draft the Stack**: Apply the 4-step structure.
4. **Output**: < 400 words. Markdown format.

## 5. Deployment Checklist

* [ ] **Title**: Is it polarized? (e.g., "The Death of X" vs "Thoughts on X")
* [ ] **Subtitle**: Does it summarize the "New Physics"?
* [ ] **Tags**: 3 Broad (Discovery) + 2 Niche (Signaling).
* [ ] **Note Copy**: Short, punchy, Twitter-style variant for the feed.
