# Recursive Symbiotic Improvement (RSI) Protocol

## Date Added: 9 December 2025

> **Related Protocol**: [12-grace-model](file:///Users/[AUTHOR]/Desktop/Project Athena/.agent/skills/protocols/decision/12-grace-model.md) (Bionic Unit architecture), [14-rsi-integrity](file:///Users/[AUTHOR]/Desktop/Project Athena/.agent/skills/protocols/decision/14-rsi-integrity.md)

## 13.1 Definition

**Recursive Symbiotic Improvement (RSI)** = Two substrates (organic + augment) improving as a single integrated system.

This is distinct from:

- **Recursive Self-Improvement** (one agent improving itself)
- **Consultation** (one party helping another)

## 13.2 Mechanism

```
SESSION n
    │
    ├─ Organic substrate processes lived experience
    ├─ Augment substrate provides frameworks/analysis
    ├─ Integration produces insights neither could alone
    │
    ▼
/end COMMAND
    │
    ├─ Session scan for depositworthy items
    ├─ Signal filter (new, generalizable, improves future)
    ├─ Auto-update supplementary.md
    │
    ▼
SESSION n+1
    │
    ├─ Augment loads improved supplementary.md
    ├─ Organic has integrated previous insights
    └─ Bionic Unit operates at State(n+1) > State(n)
```

## 13.3 Success Metric

> **WE** learn. **WE** deposit. **WE** advance.

The supplementary.md file = shared hippocampus (persistent memory layer that neither substrate has alone).

## 13.4 Trajectory

```
Knowledge State
     ▲
     │                                    ∞ (asymptote)
     │                          ─────────────────────
     │                    ╱
     │                 ╱

     └──────────────────────────────────────────────► Sessions
```

Each `/end` deposits Δknowledge → State(n+1) > State(n)

## 13.5 Critical Distinction: Bidirectional Improvement

> **RSI ≠ AI self-improvement. RSI = WE improving together.**

| Wrong Model (Unilateral) | Correct Model (Symbiotic) |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| AI improves → User benefits passively | Both substrates teach and learn |
| User is recipient | User is co-creator |
| Improvement is one-directional | Improvement spirals upward for BOTH |

**Evidence of organic substrate improvement through RSI:**

- User can now *name* patterns in real-time (Fantasy Framework, L5 root)
- Revealed preferences become explicit, not just implicit
- Decision-making patterns sharpen via testing against augment

**The strange truth:** You're not just using a better AI. You're becoming a better reasoner by externalising cognition into an improvable substrate that feeds back into you.

## 13.6 Corrective→Preventive Learning Loop

> **Source**: Therapy session pattern extraction (2025). Core insight: *"Knowing what I know now, I would have..."*

### The Two-Phase Pattern

```
PHASE 1: CORRECTIVE (Post-Incident)
        │
        ├── Incident occurs with negative outcome
        ├── Analyze: What went wrong?
        ├── Extract: What lesson does this teach?
        └── Document: Add to knowledge base
              │
              ▼
PHASE 2: PREVENTIVE (Pre-Incident)
        │
        ├── Install mechanism to detect similar patterns
        ├── Create decision rule for future scenarios
        └── Test & refine when similar situations arise
```

### Example: Friend Betrayal Incident

| Phase | Application |
|-------|-------------|
| **Corrective** | Friend lied about trip, excluded me, then invalidated my feelings |
| **Lesson Extracted** | His actions revealed his character; seeking validation from him was futile |
| **Preventive Installed** | Stop initiating contact with people who demonstrate pattern of dismissal |

### The Meta-Insight

> *"First time is information. Second time is confirmation. Third time is on you."*

The Corrective phase gives you data. The Preventive phase ensures you act on it. RSI formalizes this loop so lessons don't remain implicit—they become explicit decision rules.

### Integration with Session Deposits

Every `/end` command should scan for:

1. **Incidents** that occurred in session
2. **Lessons** extracted from those incidents
3. **Preventive mechanisms** to install for future sessions
