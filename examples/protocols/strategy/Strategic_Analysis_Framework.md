# Protocol: Strategic Analysis Framework ("The Mammoth")

> **Purpose**: Unified consulting stack for moving from macro landscape analysis to actionable strategic roadmaps.
> **Value**: Converts tactical tasks into high-value strategic consulting ($2k-$10k value).

## 1. The Full Stack (Sequential Execution)

### Phase 1: Macro Landscape (PESTLE Analysis)

- **Tool**: PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental).
- **Goal**: Identify external forces beyond control that can be exploited.
- **Key Question**: "What is the world doing to this industry right now?"

### Phase 2: Micro Audit (BMC & 4-Fits)

- **Tool**: Business Model Canvas (Simplified) + Balfour’s Four Fits.
- **4-Fits Check**:
    1. **Market-Product**: Does the market actually want this?
    2. **Product-Channel**: Can we reach them effectively?
    3. **Channel-Model**: Does the math (CAC/LTV) work?
    4. **Market-Model**: Will they pay the required price?
- **Goal**: Identify internal bottlenecks (Traffic vs. Conversion vs. Capacity).

### Phase 3: Synthesis (SWOT / TOWS Matrix)

- **Goal**: Collide Internal (Strengths/Weaknesses) with External (Opportunities/Threats).
- **TOWS Moves**:
    1. **SO (Yield)**: Use Assets to capture Trends.
    2. **WO (Pivot)**: Use Trends to fix Weaknesses.
    3. **ST (Defense)**: Use Assets to block Threats.
    4. **WT (Survival)**: Cut or Exit strategy.

### Phase 4: The 3-Phase Roadmap

- **Foundation**: Fix the leaks (Landing pages, Admin, Trust).
- **Yield**: Raise the throughput (Optimization, Pricing, Automation).
- **Expansion**: New inventory/segments (Scale).

## 2. Core Heuristics

### First Principles Decomposition

- Breakdown every claim into its atomic parts.
- Ask: "Is this objectively true, or a legacy assumption?"
- **Rule**: If a strategy relies on an assumption that changed in 2024+, ignore it.

### Risk Triaging

- Do not process raw data yourself initially.
- Categorize leads/problems into **High/Medium/Low Risk** based on budget, clarity, and timeline.
