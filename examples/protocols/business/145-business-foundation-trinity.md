# Protocol 145: PMOF Trinity (The Prerequisite Check)

> **Type**: Strategy / Diagnostics
> **Context**: Business Viability Assessment
> **Parent Framework**: [Protocol 162 (PMOF/PMOD)](file:///Users/[AUTHOR]/Desktop/Project Athena/.agent/skills/protocols/strategy/162-product-market-operations-fit.md)
> **Tags**: #business #pmof #fundamentals #pmf #distribution #operations

## 1. Core Thesis

Before applying the full [PMOF Framework (Protocol 162)](file:///Users/[AUTHOR]/Desktop/Project Athena/.agent/skills/protocols/strategy/162-product-market-operations-fit.md) or Balfour's Four Fits, a business must satisfy the **Fundamental Trinity** (L0).

> **Relationship**:
>
> * **PMOF (Protocol 162)** = The Full Engine (Problem, Market, Ops, Distribution).
> * **PMOF Trinity (Protocol 145)** = The Ignition Key (Viability Check).

## 2. The Trinity Components (L0)

### Node 1: Product-Market Fit (The "Want")

* **Question**: "Does anybody want the shit you are selling?"
* **Failure State**: Building in a vacuum. Wasting time on polished solutions for non-existent problems.
* **Metric**: "Pull" (People asking for it / Paying for it).

### Node 2: Distribution (The "Churn")

* **Question**: "Are you regularly churning out content for your target audience?"
* **Archetype**: **The StickerLah Dog** (dchtoons).
  * Relentless, daily output.
  * Short-form, SEO, Testimonials.
  * "Working like a dog" = The necessary friction of visibility.
* **Failure State**: Great product, silence in the market. "Build it and they will come" fallacy.

### Node 3: Operations (The "Promise")

* **Question**: "Can you genuinely solve the problem?"
* **Archetype**: **The VDestiny Standard**.
  * Marketing promise: "Love Making" (Premium/Connection).
  * Operational reality: Must deliver "Love Making," not "Cheap Sex" (Geylang Standard).
* **Failure State**: The "Bucket with a Hole." Great marketing (Distribution) + High Demand (PMF) + Bad Delivery (Ops) = Rapid Reputation Ruin.

## 3. The Trinity vs. The Four Fits

The Trinity is the **Prerequisite Layer (L0)**. The Four Fits is the **Scaling Layer (L1)**.

| Layer | Model | Focus | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **L0** | **The Trinity** | Viability & Existence | Starting, fixing "broken" businesses, reality check. |
| **L1** | **Four Fits** | Scale & Ecosystem | Growing from $1M to $100M, optimizing channels. |

> **Directive**: If L0 is not green, L1 is irrelevant. Don't optimize the Channel-Model fit if you can't deliver the Op (Node 3) or if nobody wants it (Node 1).
